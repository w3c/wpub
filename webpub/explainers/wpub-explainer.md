# Publication Manifest Explainer


## Introduction

Many types of publications consist of an ordered sequence of resources, which may be textual, audio, or images. The Publication Manifest defines a model for expressing this sequence of primary resources, as well as enumerating ancillary resources and providing metadata for the publication as a whole.

We also define serializations of this model in JSON-LD, with a vocabulary largely based on schema.org. Initial work will focus on audio books, but we plan to extend the model to encompass web publications, digital sequential art such as comics, manga, and bandes desinees, scholarly publications, and educational publications. 

## Goals

 
- Provide a mechanism for defining a collection of resources as a publication. The resources may be HTML, images (comics/manga), audio files (audiobooks), or even data files which would not be rendered.

- Provide a mechanism for defining an ordering of the resources in a publication

- Provide a mechanism for ascribing descriptive metadata to a collection of web resources.


 
## Non-goals

 - Describe the affordances needed for reading publications on the web. (This is being done by PWG in a separate document.)

 - Issues of layout, such as pagination or displaying different resources side-by-side.
 
 - Extending the DOM to include collections of document elements 
 
 - DRM
 
## Basic design

A Publication must have an *entry page*, which is the HTML document found at the URL of the publication. This page must have either a link to the manifest (`<link rel="publication" href="manifest.json">`, or an [embedded](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/327) manifest. 

The term “manifest” originally described a list of the passengers or cargo on a ship. For publications, a manifest lists the constituents of the publication—all the HTML files, stylesheets, images, scripts, etc.—needed to create the whole. One list, called the `readingOrder`, describes the default sequence of primary resources, so that we know that `chapter-02.html` comes after `chapter-01.html`. Another list, called simply `resources`, lists all the other associated files. The union of `readingOrder` and `resources` defines the bounds of the publication. 

The manifest is also the natural location for metadata that applies to the whole publication, rather than just one of the constituents. The metadata vocabulary is based on schema.org; the entire manifest is serialized as JSON-LD, as it is a syntax of choice for schema.org.


## Example Manifest

Here's a simple example of a publication manifest, for a tiny version of *Moby-Dick* with only a few HTML files:

```json
{
    "@context": ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "type": "Book",
    "url": "https://publisher.example.org/mobydick",
    "author": "Herman Melville",
    "dateModified": "2018-02-10T17:00:00Z",

    "readingOrder": [
        "html/title.html",
        "html/copyright.html",
        "html/introduction.html",
        "html/epigraph.html",
        "html/c001.html",
        "html/c002.html",
        "html/c003.html",
        "html/c004.html",
        "html/c005.html",
        "html/c006.html"
    ],

    "resources": [
        "css/mobydick.css",
        {
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "rel": "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp#cover-page",
            "url": "images/cover.jpg",
            "encodingFormat": "image/jpeg"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "html/toc.html",
            "rel": "contents"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneral.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralBol.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralBolIta.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralItalic.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        }
    ]
}

```

Note how we used `rel=contents` to identify that a particular resource is an HTML table of contents.

## Modularity

Our goal is a model that is very slim, focused almost exclusively on the metadata aspects of a publication. All information about affordances and behaviors will move to the [WP Use Cases and Requirements Documents](https://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/). Detailed information about specific types of publications will go into stand-alone modules as business needs arise. The first module will be audiobooks (see the [separate explainer](./audio-explainer.md)). Future modules might include comics/manga/bandes dessinées and scholarly publishing. 


## Design choices


The design of publication manifests has caused perhaps the greatest amount of discussion within the group, and centers around three key areas:

1. how best to identify the "bounds" of the publication;
2. how best to define the ordering of the primary resources; and
3. how best to express metadata for the publication as a whole.

This section outlines the current approaches that have been adopted in each of these areas, and lists alternative practices that have been discussed and/or influenced the decision-making process. The currently-adopted solutions may change as discussions evolve and external feedback is obtained.


### 1. What is part of the publication?

The Publishing Working Group has chosen to use an explicit list of resources in the manifest to identify the bounds. Anything that is not part of the `resources` or `readingOrder` manifest members is considered to be outside the web publication.

Precedent for this design pattern can be found in EPUB, which includes a comprehensive listing of publication resources in the package document `manifest` element.

The group has also considered the patterns described below, but currently believes an explicit list is the best choice in terms of simplicity and flexibility (e.g., incorporating resources from across the Web).

- Using a `scope`, as was done in the [Web Application Manifest spec](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/).

- Not explicitly define the boundaries, similar to how web sites function.

- Using the notion of *transclusion*, where the contents of other documents can be incorporated into a parent document based on hypertext references (e.g., through iframes, HTML imports, custom elements, etc.). For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Moby-Dick</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <web-publication>
      <iframe src="c001.html">
      <iframe src="c002.html">
      <iframe src="c003.html">
    </web-publication>
  </body>
</html>

```


### 2. Sequence of primary resources

Publication manifests use an explicit list in the manifest to define the reading sequence &#8212; via the `readingOrder` member.

This design choice also has precedent in EPUB, which defines the order of content documents in the package document `spine` element.

Other methods considered to achieve sequencing include:

- `rel=prev` and `rel=next` in HTML, but these do not have UI support from the browsers (with notably rare exceptions) and are not available for most non-HTML media types.

- identifying sequence via a list of links in a `nav` element (e.g., the table of contents), but not all resources may be listed in the table of contents

- the DOM order of transcluded documents


### 3. Metadata

Publication metadata is expressed in the manifest using the schema.org vocabulary, with some extensions. The metadata is serialized as JSON-LD, one of the three syntaxes promoted by schema.org and understood by search crawlers (the others being microdata and RDFa). JSON-LD has also the advantage of being easy to use for both client and server side processing.

The encapsulation of metadata is not new or unique to Web Publications, so precedent can be found in EPUB, Web App Manifest, and other standards. Where Web Publications differs is in putting priority on conformance to schema.org, which makes the metadata more Web-friendly for a wider variety of processors.

Embedding metadata directly in the header and/or content of HTML files has also been considered, but such a design presents greater complexity in terms of identifying and harvesting the information.

### A Note on Serialization

Blackstone Audio has proposed using YAML for an [audiobooks manifest](https://github.com/blackstoneaudio/audiobook-spec). Alternate serializations might help with ease-of-authoring, or even allow EPUB's package file to be expressed as a publication manifest.

## The User Experience

Reading something that takes a day or a week rather than a few minutes influences what sort of user experience works for the reader. We have a formal [use cases and requirements document](https://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/) in addition to lots of actual experience from ebook reading systems. Browsers have implemented "reading modes" to address some of these requirements. 


## Unanswered questions


### Architecture

Andrew Betts, then on the TAG, [commented](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32#issuecomment-362273649):

> It seems to us on the TAG that the Readium manifest format is very unlikely to be considered for support by implementors of general purpose web browsers. Therefore, the question seems to be: is the goal of this group to make a new packaging format for specialist book reading software and devices, or is it to obtain first class support for missing book-related features in the web platform as a whole? If the latter, then it is an order of magnitude more likely to be achieved by building atop existing platform features - notably Web App Manifest and service worker, than creating a separate but similar concept.

It is true that the Publication Manifest appears to be very similar to the Web Application Manifest &#8212; both are JSON files that are linked to from HTML, and both provide metadata about a composite resource. Several [arguments](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/wiki/Options-for-Processing-a-Manifest) [have](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32) been made against building on top of WAM, however:

1. Publication use cases are orthogonal to those of WAM. Nothing is stopping a creator of a publication from also using a web application manifest, if the publication author desires for the publication to be installable, etc. 

2. A primary objective of web publications is to make publication metadata available for SEO. We feel that schema.org metadata is the best way to do this, but this implies using JSON-LD, which is not compatible with the syntax of WAM. 

3. There were concerns about the extensibility of web application manifest, especially with regards to the processing of new members. 

4. Publications are fundamentally different from web apps, as the goal is for the user agent to provide the user interface. 

As a result, the working group has spent much of its time on a high-level data model, and work on identifying low-level primitives has been deferred.


### Addressability

A publication needs a permanent URL, and it should be possible to craft a URL to point anywhere within a publication. 


### Packaging

The working group has decided to adopt a lightweight version of the [ISO standardization of Zip](https://www.iso.org/standard/60101.html), along with a well-known location for the manifest. We require a packaging standard that is easy to implement and ready for market now. This packaging will be aimed at any module. We are carefully monitoring the [web packaging](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage) effort for future use.
