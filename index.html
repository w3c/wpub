			<p>This specification defines a collection of information that describes the structure of Web Publications
				so that user agents can provide user experiences tailored to reading publications, such as sequential
				navigation and offline reading. This information includes the default reading order, a list of
				resources, and publication-wide metadata.</p>

			<p>This draft provides a preliminary outline of a Web Publication. Many details are under active

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="what-is-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>What is a Web Publication</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information
					about the Web Publication is expressed in a machine-readable document called a <a>manifest</a>,
					which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection
					between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describe the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity
					and nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources
					that belong to the Web Publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources
					into a single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable in one of two ways: resources either include a link to the manifest
					(via an HTTP Link header or an HTML <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!html]]), or the manifest can
					be loaded directly by a compatible user agent.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored
					specifically for their unique reading needs.</p>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the
					way that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type
					of work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the
					consumption of Web Publications. While a primary goal is that traditional Web user agents (browsers)
					will be able to consume Web Publications, this should not limit the capabilities of any other
					possible type of user agent (e.g., applications, whether standalone or running within a user agent,
					or even Web Publications that include their own user interface). As a result, the specification does
					not attempt to architect required solutions for situations whose expected outcome will vary
					depending on the nature of the user agent and the expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to
					initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how much of a Web Publication to cache for offline
					use).</p>

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication conforms to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it has a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to <a href="#manifest-req"></a>;</li>

		<section id="infoset">
			<h2>Information Set</h2>

			<p class="ednote">As the serialization of the manifest remains an open issue, specifics about how properties
				are compiled into the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> remain under-specified. This
				includes, but is not limited to, what specific names the properties will have in the <abbr

				those in the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> and/or whether mappings to properties from
				known vocabularies will be used.</p>

			<p class="issue" data-number="63">The name "<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>" might change

			<section id="infoset-expl" class="informative">
				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is defined by a set of properties known as its <dfn data-lt="infoset"
						>information set</dfn> (<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>). The <abbr
						title="information set">infoset</abbr> is logically divided into two sets of properties: those
					that describe the publication and those that express key structures. These classifications only
					exist for the purposes of understanding the function of the properties, however.</p>

				<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the
					sense that it represents a set of information that a user agent has to compile about the Web
					Publication, but it also becomes concrete when the user agent creates an internal representation of
					that information.</p>

				<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is primarily compiled from a Web Publication's
						<a>manifest</a>, whose serialization requirements are defined in <a
						href="#manifest-serialization"></a>. Some information can be obtained outside the
					manifest—fallback rules for properties defined in the following subsections allow a user agent to
					compile information that the author has not provided in the manifest, for example.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="infoset-req">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>

				<p>The requirements for the expression of <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> properties
					are as follows:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Descriptive Properties</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>REQUIRED: <a href="#wp-address">address</a></p>

				<h3>Descriptive Properties</h3>

				<section id="wp-a11y">
					<h4>Accessibility Report</h4>

					<p>An accessibility report provides information about the suitability of a <a>Web Publication</a>
						for consumption by users with varying preferred reading modalities. These reports typically
						identify the result of an evaluation against established accessibility criteria, such as those
						provided in [[WCAG20]], and are an important source of information in determining the usability
						of a Web Publication.</p>

					<p>The <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> SHOULD include a link to an accessibility
						report when one is available for a Web Publication. It is RECOMMENDED that the report be
						included as a resource of the Web Publication.</p>

					<p>It is also RECOMMENDED that the accessibility report be provided in a human-readable format, such
						as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>&#160;[[!html]]. Augmenting these reports
						with machine-processable metadata, such as provided in Schema.org[[schema.org]], is also
						RECOMMENDED.</p>

					<p class="ednote">Machine-readable accessibility metadata may be recommended in whatever format is
						used to externalize publication metadata (e.g., to ensure availability for search). Depending
						how this externalizing is done, adding machine-processable accessibility metadata to such a
						record could take precedence over, or complement, the accessibility record.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-address">
					<h4>Address</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>address</dfn> is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>&#160;[[!url]] that
						represents the primary entry page for the Web Publication. If this URL does not resolve to an
							<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document&#160;[[!html]], user agents
						SHOULD NOT provide access to it to users.</p>

					<p>The referenced document SHOULD be a resource of the Web Publication. It can be any resource,
						including one that is not listed in the <a>default reading order</a>. This document MUST include
						a <a href="#wp-linking">link to the manifest</a> to ensure a bidirectional linking relationship
						(i.e., that user agents can also locate the manifest from the document at the address.</p>

					<p>If the document is not a Web Publication resource, user agents SHOULD load the first document in
						the <a>default reading order</a> when initiating the Web Publication.</p>

					<p class="note">To improve the usability of Web Publications, particularly in user agents that do
						not support Web Publications, include navigation aids in the referenced document that facilitate
						consumption of the content, (e.g., provide a table of contents or a link to one).</p>

					<p>The availability of the address does not preclude the creation and use of other identifiers
						and/or addresses to retrieve a <a>Web Publication</a>, whether in whole or in part.</p>

					<div class="note">The Web Publication's address can also be used as value for an identifier link
						relation&#160;[[link-relation]].</div>

				</section>

				<section id="wp-canonical-identifier">
					<h4>Canonical Identifier</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>canonical identifier</dfn> is a unique identifier that resolves to the preferred version of
						the Web Publication. The canonical identifier MUST be an <a>address</a> or a value that allows a
						one-to-one mapping to an address (e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier"
						>DOI</abbr>&#160;[[doi]] can be resolved to a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
						>URL</abbr>&#160;[[url]] via a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> resolver). If
						a user agent cannot resolve the canonical identifier to an address, it SHOULD ignore the
						property.</p>

					<p>If a Web Publication is hosted at more than one address, the canonical identifier allows a user
						agent to identify the shared relationship between the versions and to determine which of the
						available addresses is primary.</p>

					<p>The canonical identifier is also intended to provide a measure of permanence above and beyond the
						Web Publication's <a>address</a>. Even if a Web Publication is permanently relocated to a new
						address, for example, the canonical identifier will provide a way of locating the new location
						(e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> registry could be updated with the
						new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or a redirect could be added to the <abbr
							title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the canonical identifier).</p>

					<p>When assigned, the canonical identifier needs to be unique to one and only one Web Publication,
						independent of its address(es). Ensuring uniqueness is outside the scope of this specification,
						however. The actual uniqueness achievable depends on such factors as the conventions of the
						identifier scheme used and the degree of control over assignment of identifiers.</p>

					<p class="note">If the canonical identifier is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
						it can be used as the target of a "canonical" link&#160;[[rfc6596]] (e.g., a <code>link</code>
						element&#160;[[html]] whose <code>rel</code> attribute has the value <code>canonical</code> or
						an <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>
						<code>Link</code> header field&#160;[[rfc5988]] similarly identified).</p>

					<p class="issue" data-number="58">Is a canonical identifier necessary to call out explicitly in the
							<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>, or can it be handled by other metadata.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-creators">
					<h4>Creators</h4>

					<p>Creators are the individuals or entities responsible for the creation of the <a>Web
							Publication</a>.</p>

					<p>The creator property SHOULD include the role the creator played in the creation of the Web
						Publication (e.g., 'author', 'illustrator', 'translator').</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-language-and-dir">
					<h4>Language and Base Direction</h4>

					<p>Each textual property in the <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> (e.g., <a href="#wp-title">title</a>, <a
							href="#wp-creator">creators</a>) is <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/string-meta/#dom-localizable"
						>Localizable</a>&#160;[[string-meta]]. This means it is possible to assign:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the natural <dfn>language</dfn>, which MUST be a tag that conforms to&#160;[[!bcp47]];</li>
						<li>the <dfn>base direction</dfn>, which identifies the display direction for the property using
							one of the following possible values: <ul>
								<li><code>ltr</code>: left-to-right;</li>
								<li><code>rtl</code>: right-to-left;</li>
								<li><code>auto</code>: direction is determined from the value of the property.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The Web Publication's <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> MAY contain global language
						and the base direction declarations using the same conventions (i.e., [[!bcp47]] tags for
						language, and the values <code>ltr</code>/<code>rtl</code>/<code>auto</code> for base
						direction). These are used as defaults for textual properties in the <abbr
							title="information set">infoset</abbr>, unless overwritten by the properties themselves.</p>

					<p class="note">These features make it possible to add the title of a publication in different
						languages, or repeat the creators’ names using different scripts.</p>

					<p>User agents MUST NOT use the language and base direction outside the context of the manifest
						(e.g., in the processing or rendering of the Web Publication content). These values are
							<strong>not</strong> a replacement for such declarations in each resource as defined by its
						format.</p>

					<p>If a user agent requires the language and one is not available in the <abbr
							title="information set">infoset</abbr> (globally or specifically for the property), or the
						obtained value is invalid, the user agent MAY attempt to determine the language. This
						specification does not mandate how such a language tag is created. The user agent might:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>use the <a>non-empty</a> language declaration of the manifest;</li>
						<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default reading
								order</a>;</li>
						<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If a language tag cannot be determined, user agents MUST use the value "<code>und</code>"
						(undetermined). If the base direction cannot be determined, user agents MUST assume the value
							<code>auto</code>.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="wp-mod-date">
					<h4>Last Modification Date</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>last modification date</dfn> is the date when the <a>Web Publication</a> was last
						updated (i.e., whenever changes were last made to any of the resources of the Web Publication,
						including the <a>manifest</a>).</p>

					<p>This date does not necessarily reflect all changes to the Web Publication (e.g., third-party
						content could change without the author being aware). User agents SHOULD check the last
						modification date of individual resources to determine if they have changed and need
						updating.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-pub-date">
					<h4>Publication Date</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>publication date</dfn> is the date on which the <a>Web Publication</a> was originally
						published. It represents a static event in the lifecycle of a Web Publication and allows
						subsequent revisions to be identified and compared.</p>

					<p>The exact moment of publication is intentionally left open to interpretation: it could be when
						the Web Publication is first made available online or could be a point in time before
						publication when the Web Publication is considered final.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-reading-progression">
					<h4>Reading Progression Direction</h4>

					<p>The <dfn data-lt="reading progression direction">reading progression</dfn> establishes the
						reading direction from one resource to the next within a <a>Web Publication</a>. The value of
						this property may be:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><code>ltr</code>: left-to-right;</li>
						<li><code>rtl</code>: right-to-left;</li>
						<li><code>auto</code>: the user agent chooses the direction.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The default value is <code>auto</code>.</p>

					<p>This information item has <em>no effect</em> on the rendering of the individual primary
						resources; it is only relevant for the progression direction from one resource to the other.</p>

					<p class="note">The reading progression of a <a>Web Publication</a> is used to adapt such
						publication level interactions as menu position, swap direction, defining tap zones to lead the
						user to the next and previous pages, touch gestures, etc.</p>


				</section>

				<section id="wp-title">
					<h4>Title</h4>

					<p>The title provides the human-readable name of the <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>

					<p>When specified in the <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>, the title MUST be
							<a>non-empty</a>.</p>

					<p>If a user agent requires a title and one is not available in the <abbr title="information set"
							>infoset</abbr>, the user agent MAY create one. This specification does not mandate how such
						a title is created. The user agent might:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>use the first <a>non-empty</a>
							<code>title</code> element found in a resource in the <a>default reading order</a>;</li>
						<li>provide a language-specific placeholder title (e.g., 'Untitled Publication');</li>

				<h3>Structural Properties</h3>

				<section id="wp-default-reading-order">
					<h4>Default Reading Order</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>default reading order</dfn> is a specific progression through a set of <a>Web
							Publication</a> resources.</p>

					<p>A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such
						interaction the default reading order defines the expected progression from one resource to the
						next.</p>

					<p>The default reading order MUST include at least one resource.</p>

					<p>The default reading order is specified directly in the manifest. If the reading order consists of
						one single resource, namely the primary entry page of the Web Publication (i.e., the resource
						the user accesses to reach the manifest, see <a href="#wp-linking"></a>), the default reading
						order need not be specified in the manifest.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-resource-list">
					<h4>Resource List</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>resource list</dfn> enumerates all <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> that are used
						in the processing and rendering of a <a>Web Publication</a> (i.e., that are within its bounds)
						and that are not listed in the <a>default reading order</a>. This list is the definitive source
						that user agents have in determining which referenced resources belong to the Web Publication
						and which are external to it.</p>

					<p>The completeness of the resource list will affect the usability of the Web Publication in certain
						reading scenarios (e.g., the ability to read the Web Publication offline). For this reason, it
						is strongly RECOMMENDED to provide a comprehensive list of all of the Web Publication's
						constituent resources beyond those listed in the <a>default reading order</a>.</p>

					<p>In some cases, a comprehensive list of these resources might not be easily achieved (e.g.,
						third-party scripts that reference resources from deep within their source), but a user agent
						SHOULD still be able to render a Web Publication even if some of these resources are not
						identified as belonging to the Web Publication (e.g., when it is taken offline without
						them).</p>

					<div class="ednote"> The previous version of the draft included: <blockquote>
							<p>If a user agent encounters a resource that it cannot locate in the resource list, it MUST
								treat the resource as external to the Web Publication (e.g., it might alert the user
								before loading, open the resource in a new window, or unload the current Web Publication
								and resume normal Web browsing).</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>This was not decided on the Toronto F2F, and is still open.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section id="wp-extra-list">
					<h4>List of extra resources</h4>

					<p>
						The <dfn>list of extra resources</dfn> enumerates all 
						<a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> that are used in the processing and rendering of a <a>Web Publication</a> but are <em>not</em> within its bounds (i.e., are not listed  in the <a>default reading order</a> or the <a>resource list</a>) but are, rather, external to the Web Publication.
					</p>

					<p>The completeness of the resource list will affect the usability of the Web Publication in certain

						external resources beyond those listed in the <a>default reading order</a> or <a>resource list</a>.</p>

					<p>In some cases, a comprehensive list of these resources might not be easily achieved (e.g.,

				<section id="wp-table-of-contents">
					<h4>Table of Contents</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>table of contents</dfn> is a hierarchical list of links that reflects the structural
						outline of the major sections of the Web Publication. There are no requirements on the
						completeness of the table of contents, except that, when specified, it MUST include a link to at
						least one <a href="#wp-resources">resource</a>.</p>

					<p> The table of contents is not specified directly in the manifest. Instead, the manifest SHOULD
						provide a link to an HTML element in one of the <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> (most
						likely a <code>nav</code> element&#160;[[!html]]), with a <code>role</code> attribute value set
						to <code>doc-toc</code>. </p>

					<p class="issue">This question arises only if the table of contents is accepted: can a table of

				</section>

				<section id="wp-cover">
					<h4>Cover</h4>

					<p>The <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> SHOULD include a reference to a cover
						image. This image can be used by user agents to present the <a>Web Publication</a> to users
						(e.g., in a library or bookshelf, or when initially loading the Web Publication).</p>

					<p>User agents SHOULD NOT use the cover image as the sole means of selecting or accessing Web
						Publications. A user agent SHOULD use the Web Publication's <a href="#wp-title">title</a> and <a
							href="#wp-creators">creators</a> as text alternatives for such interfaces.</p>

					<p>More than one cover image MAY be referenced from the infoset to provide alternative sizes and
						resolutions for different device screens.</p>

					<p>A user agent MAY create a cover for a Web Publication if one is not present. This specification
						does not define requirements for the creation of such cover images (e.g., the user agent could
						use a placeholder image, generate an image dynamically, or incorporate properties of the infoset
						into a graphic, such as the title or creators).</p>

				<section id="wp-privacy">
					<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

					<p>Users often have the legal right to know and control what information is collected about them,
						how such information is stored and for how long, whether it is personally identifiable, and how
						it can be expunged. Including a statement that addresses all such privacy concerns is
						consequently an important part of publishing <a>Web Publications</a>. Even if no information is
						collected, such a declaration increases the trust users have in the content.</p>

					<p>To address this concern, a link to a privacy policy can be included in the <abbr
							title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>. It is RECOMMENDED that the privacy policy be
						included as a resource of the Web Publication.</p>

					<p>It is RECOMMENDED that the privacy policy be provided in a human-readable format, such as <abbr
							title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>&#160;[[!html]].</p>

					extended in the following ways:</p>

					<li>through the inclusion of additional properties in the manifest;</li>

			<h2>Web Publication Manifest</h2>

			<section id="manifest-intro">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p> A <a>manifest</a> is a serialization of a <a>Web Publication's</a>
					<abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>. The manifest is serialized using the
					JSON&#160;[[!ecma-404]], more specifically the JSON-LD&#160;[[!json-ld]] format. The manifest can be
					a separate JSON-LD file, or it can be part of an HTML resource using the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element"
							><code>script</code> element</a> in HTML&#160;[[!html]]. If the latter, the
						<code>type</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> element MUST be set to
						<code>application/ld+json</code>. </p>

				<pre class="example" title="A Web Publication Manifest included in an HTML resource">
	&lt;script id="example_manifest" type="application/ld+json"&gt;
	{
    ...
	}
	&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

				<section>
					<h4>Descriptive Infoset Properties</h4>

					<p>
						<a href="infoset-meta">Desciptive Properties</a> in the Web Publication Manifest are based,
						wherever possible, on the terms defined by <a href="https://schema.org"
						>Schema.org</a>&#160;[[schema.org]] (including <a href="http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html"
							>hosted extensions</a> of Schema.org). This means that the descriptive infoset properties
						are mapped to one or several Schema.org properties (inheriting their syntax and semantics). </p>

					<p class="note"> Schema.org includes a large number of terms that, though relevant for publishing,
						are not mentioned in this Recommendation. Web Publication authors may use any of those; this
						document defines only the minimal set of infoset items, and their mapping to Schema.org when
						appropriate. </p>

					<p class="ednote"> There are discussion on whether a best practices document would be created,
						referring to more schema.org terms. If so, it should be linked from here. </p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h4>Structural Infoset Properties</h4>

					<p>
						<a href="infoset-structure">Structural Properties</a> in the Web Publication Manifest use terms
						that refer to one or more external resources (images, script files, separate metadata files,
						etc.). These terms do not necessarily have a counterpart in Schema.org, and are therefore
						defined separately by this specification. </p>

					<p> Values of structural properties are usually links to external resources, or an array thereof.
						Such a link may be expressed in one of two ways: </p>

					<ol>
						<li>a string encoding the (absolute or relative) URL of the resources; or</li>
						<li>an instance of a Schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/StructuredValue"
									><code>StructuredValue</code></a> that can be used to express, beyond the URL, the
							media type and other characteristics of the target resource.</li>
					</ol>

					<pre class="example" title="Expressing external links, either as strings or as objects">
	{
        ...
        "resources" : [
            "datatypes.svg",
            {
                "@type"      : "StructuredValue",
                "url"        : "test-utf8.csv",
                "fileFormat" : "text/csv"
            }
		]
	}
</pre>

					<p class="note"> There will be continuous contacts with Schema.org to see whether some of the
						structural property terms should not be included in the core Schema.org hierarchy, or one of its
						extensions. </p>
				</section>

				<section id="wpub-context">
					<h4>Web Publication Manifest Contexts</h4>

					<p> A Web Publication Manifest MUST start by setting the appropriate (JSON-LD) contexts. This
						context has two major components: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>the “core” Schema.org context, i.e., <code>http://schema.org</code>;</li>
						<li>the separate, WP-specific context file: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/wpub.jsonld</code></li>
					</ul>

					<p> Note that the latter may also add some features to terms defined in Schema.org. </p>

					<div class="note">
						<p> An example for the latter is the requirement for the <a href="https://schema.org/creator"
								>creator</a> term to be order preserving. </p>
						<p> As part of the continuous contacts with Schema.org the additional requirements defined in
							the WP specific context file may migrate to the core Schema.org. </p>
					</div>

					<p> In practice, this means that a Web Publication Manifest MUST begin with, at the minimum: </p>

					<pre class="example">
{
    "@context" : ["http://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wpub.jsonld"],
    ...
}
</pre>

					<p> In some cases, this structure may have to be extended by additional, local information, see the
							<a href="#manifest-language-and-dir"></a>. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Publication Types</h4>
					<p> The manifest MUST also include a <dfn>Publication Type</dfn>. This MAY be mapped onto the
						Schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><code>CreativeWork</code></a> type, using
						the <code>@type</code> of JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]]. Schema.org also includes a number of more
						specific types (see the <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">list</a> on the Schema.org
						site) which include a type for <a href="http://schema.org/Article">Article</a>, <a
							href="http://schema.org/Book">Book</a>, or <a href="http://schema.org/Course">Course</a>;
						these may MAY also be used instead of <code>CreativeWork</code>. </p>
					<pre class="example" title="Setting type of the publication to be a Book">
{
    "@context" : ["http://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wpub.jsonld"],

			<h2>Web Publication Lifecycle</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>The publishing working group is currently evaluating the best approach for implementing <a>Web
						Publications</a> in user agents. This note is intended to provide an overview of where current
					thinking is at and what issues are under consideration.</p>

				<p>The development of Web Publications is not viewed as a separate forking of the Web, but an
					enhancement layer that can be supported by user agents. To that end, the primary constraints on any
					solution for Web Publications are that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the rendering of Web Publications must not interfere with the underlying Web model and <abbr
							title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> &#8212; all functionality and
						enhancements must be layered on top;</li>
					<li>a Web Publication should not have to carry its own implementation code &#8212; functionality is
						ideally provided by the user agent and/or polyfill.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While this specification will provide implementation flexibility for user agents, there are still a
					number of areas that have been identified as potentially needing to be detailed. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>initialization expectations for a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>automatic initiation v. user prompts;</li>
							<li>linked v. directly loaded manifests;</li>
							<li>resources that belong to more than one Web Publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>the creation of a "publication state":</p>
						<ul>
							<li>persistence of publication information across page loads;</li>
							<li>location and persistence of UI;</li>
							<li>indications of supported features;</li>
							<li>DOM issues such as persistence of numbering schemes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>tracking the extent of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>taking an entire publication offline;</li>
							<li>enabling search across documents.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>establishing the bounds of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>when to end the publication state;</li>
							<li>document history traversal;</li>
							<li>how to handle links outside the publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>updating of the <a>manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The working group intends to flesh out the lifecycle in later revisions once it is clearer what
					models are viable and what solutions can be standardized. Input on the feasibility and challenges of
					these approaches is welcome at any time.</p>

				<section id="layout">
					<h4>Layout</h4>

					<p>The layout and rendering of <a>Web Publications</a> is governed by the same rules that apply to
						all Web content: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents are styled and
						laid out according to the rules of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, SVG
						documents are rendered as defined by that format, etc. This specification requires no particular
						profile or subset of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr
							title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics"
							>SVG</abbr> to be supported, other than the expectations set for these technologies by their
						respective specifications.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This specification intentionally avoids introducing any new layout features. Any shortcoming
							of the Web platform in terms of layout needs to be addressed for the whole Web platform,
							which means via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

						<p>This working group will work with other relevant groups of the <abbr
								title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to address platform-wide limitations that
							negatively impact <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>For the purposes of layout, each resource of a Web Publication is treated as a separate document.
						User agents MUST NOT mix content from multiple resources in the same rendering (e.g., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS floats</a> or <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#absolutely-positioned">absolutely positioned
							elements</a> from one resource cannot intrude or overlap with content from an other
						resource).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Despite this general requirement that each resource should be treated as a separate document
							for the purpose of layout, there are some places where <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"
								>CSS</abbr> specifications should be amended to be able to deal more intelligently with
							collections of resources like <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>

						<p>One instance is the definition of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-content/#cross-references">cross-references</a>,
							which are currently restricted to work only within a single document. This restriction
							should be relaxed to allow for cross-references between separate resources of a single Web
							Publication.</p>

						<p>Another related would be to allow <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#counter-properties">counters</a> to
							accumulate across multiple resources of a single Web Publication (e.g., so that figures in
							multiple sections may be numbered in a single sequence).</p>

				<section id="aff-user-settings">

						<li>text size;</li>
						<li>font family;</li>
						<li>display mode (night, high contrast, etc.);</li>

					<p>This specification does not cover how user agents override author styles to offer user
						settings.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To provide user settings in their reader mode, browsers usually get rid of most of the author
							styles. There is always a tension in reading environments between author styles and the

				<section id="scrolling-or-paginating" class="informative">
					<h4>Scrolling or Paginating</h4>

					<p>Publications have historically been presented via paged media, whereas Web pages almost always
						scroll. As the preferences of individual readers vary, and as different types of publications
						are better suited for one or the other, this specification encourages user agents to support
						both, and to offer a choice to their users.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>It might be useful for authors to be able to specify a preference between scrolling and
							pagination, even if a strict requirement is not possible. This should most likely be
							addressed through an extension of <a

								><code>@viewport</code></a> or of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta">the viewport meta

								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#at-page-rule"><code>@page</code></a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). This should be discussed with the relevant working groups (<a

					<h4>Paginated Layout</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a> in a paginated layout, it MUST lay out each
						document in the <a>default reading order</a> sequentially, with the last page of a resource
						being followed by the first page of the subsequent one.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To avoid blank pages, if a resource ends on a left page (resp. right page), the subsequent

								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]) would otherwise lead to it starting on the opposite page. It
							should also be possible to use the <a

							(see&#160;[[!css-break-3]]) to force the content to resume on the opposite side if that was
							desired by the author.</p>

						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended to describe this exception to the general behavior when
							dealing with collections of documents instead of individual documents.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="ednote">
						<p>How is pagination supposed to work when subsequent resources have opposite <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> directions

							not necessarily a problem from a layout point of view, as each page is independent, but from
							an UI point of view. If swiping left means next page until the end of one chapter, and
							starts meaning previous page in the next chapter because the language is switched from

					<h4>Reading Order</h4>

					<p>Hyperlinks are the means by which multiple resources are linked together on the Web. When users

					<p>The <a>default reading order</a> provides an enhancement to the hyperlink model, allowing the

			<h3>Web Publication Locators</h3>

			<p class="ednote"> The document referred from this section, i.e., Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]], has been recently renamed. Its previous was "Locators for Web
				Publication". The terminology used in this section has to be realigned with the name change. </p>

			<p>Locators are used to identify, locate, retrieve, and/or reference locations and content fragments within
					<a>Web Publications</a> (e.g., for address(es), bookmarks, and annotations). Locators traditionally
				take the form of fragment identifiers&#160;[[rfc3986]], where the portion of a <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> preceded by a number sign character (<code>#</code>)
				identifies a specific position within the referenced resource.</p>

			<p>For some use cases, it is essential to identify and reference a <a>Web Publication</a> resource—or a
				location in or a segment of a resource—in the scope or context of the Web Publication to which it
				belongs. A traditional fragment identifier cannot satisfy this requirement, since only the <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the constituent resource containing the location or
				content fragment of interest is expressed. The Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]] document, based on the Web Annotation Model&#160;[[!annotation-model]],
				addresses this issue by providing the means to express both the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
					>URL</abbr> of the resource and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the Web
				Publication.</p>

			<p>Web Publication Locators also address the problem of referencing into a resource that was not authored
				with such a need in mind. A fragment identifier can only reference elements with explicit identifiers
				and locations with explicit anchor points. Web Publication Locators include a variety of selectors that
				work with the general structures and content of a resource (e.g., text selectors, <abbr
					title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selectors).</p>

			<p class="ednote">As Web Publication Locators currently rely on a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"
					>JSON</abbr>-based expression syntax, it is not yet clear how much of this syntax can be translated
				to a fragment identifier. This may limit the usefulness beyond expressions that are also <abbr
					title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-based (e.g., outside of annotations or
				bookmarks).</p>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>Illustrate with example of an easy to understand Web Publication Locator, such as might be used in
					annotating a simple Web Publication.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The semantics of Web Publication Locators are a mapping and extension of the Web Annotation Data
				Model&#160;[[annotation-model]] and Vocabulary&#160;[[annotation-vocab]] for describing and referencing
				a segment of a Web resource. As a result, Web Publication Locators provide the expressiveness needed for
				a broad range of annotation and bookmarking use cases. Additionally, Web Publication Locators provide a
				way to identify and reference a location within a Web Publication (i.e., as distinct from identifying
				and referencing a content fragment consisting of a span of characters or bytes). A Web Publication
				Locator can be used to identify, retrieve and/or reference a fragment of a Web Publication that spans
				multiple resources. </p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In composing a Web Publication Locator, use the <a>canonical identifier</a> of the Web Publication in
					preference to any alternative addresses. Such use facilitates the collation of Web Publication
					Locators associated with a particular Web Publication. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators"
						>URLs</abbr> of Web Publication resources appearing in a Web Publication Locator should match
					the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URL</abbr> of the resource provided in the <abbr
						title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Although a Web Publication manifest is authored as [[json-ld]], user agents process this information
					into an internal data structure representing the infoset in order to utilize the properties. The
					exact manner in which this processing occurs, and how the data is used internally, is user
					agent-dependent. To ensure interoperability when exposing the infoset items, however, this appendix
					defines a common, abstract representation of the data structures using the standard formalism of the
					Web Interface Definition Language [[webidl-1]] which can express the expected names, datatypes, and
					possible restrictions for each member of the infoset. (A WebIDL representation can be mapped onto
					ECMAScript, C, or other programming languages.)</p>
