			<p>This specification defines a collection of information that describes the structure of Web Publications
				so that user agents can provide user experiences tailored to reading publications, such as sequential
				navigation and offline reading. This information includes the default reading order, a list of
				resources, and publication-wide metadata.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<p>This draft provides a preliminary outline of a Web Publication. Many details are under active
				consideration within the Publishing Working Group and are subject to change. The most prominent known

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="what-is-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>What is a Web Publication</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information
					about the Web Publication is expressed in a machine-readable document called a <a>manifest</a>,
					which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection
					between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describe the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity
					and nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources
					that belong to the Web Publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources
					into a single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable in one of two ways: resources either include a link to the manifest
					(via an HTTP Link header or an HTML <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!html]]), or the manifest can
					be loaded directly by a compatible user agent.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored
					specifically for their unique reading needs.</p>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the
					way that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type
					of work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the
					consumption of Web Publications. While a primary goal is that traditional Web user agents (browsers)
					will be able to consume Web Publications, this should not limit the capabilities of any other
					possible type of user agent (e.g., applications, whether standalone or running within a user agent,
					or even Web Publications that include their own user interface). As a result, the specification does
					not attempt to architect required solutions for situations whose expected outcome will vary
					depending on the nature of the user agent and the expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to
					initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how much of a Web Publication to cache for offline
					use).</p>

				<h3>Relationship to Other Specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel-wam">
					<h4>Web App Manifest</h4>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>The working group is investigating integration with the work done on the Web App
							Manifest&#160;[[appmanifest]] specification to avoid duplication of concerns both in the
							expression and serialization of a <a>manifest</a> and in the processing and compilation of
							the <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>. It is expected, however, that there
							will be differences in the processing models of each (e.g., the initiation of the reading
							experience for <a>Web Publications</a> versus installation for applications).</p>

						<p>The working assumption is that both applications and publications can use the same manifest
							and serialization to express the information necessary to initiate themselves.</p>

						<p>The initial stage of evaluating this assumption involves:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>the continuing analysis of necessary metadata and publication structure
								requirements;</li>
							<li>the comparison and harmonization of web publication requirements with those already
								defined in Web App Manifest.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The next stage will involve the serialization of the <abbr title="information set"
								>infoset</abbr> in <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> to see how this
							expression of the manifest can be aligned with the expression of the web app manifest.
							Wherever semantically possible, the terms used and defined for web app manifests will be
							reused, and, conversely, some of the members defined for Web Publications may be generally
							useful for applications and may be added to the Web App Manifest specification as a common
							pool of information. To avoid possible future conflicts, care will be taken to use a naming
							scheme that clearly separates terms to be used for Web Publications only.</p>

						<p>This specification consequently should be read and understood in this context of an ongoing
							investigation, and that significant changes may occur in the future.</p>

						<p>This section will be updated as appropriate to reflect the current status of this work, and
							describe the evolving relationship.</p>

						<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32">issue #32 in the GitHub tracker</a>
							for more discussion about integration.</p>

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication conforms to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it has a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to <a href="#manifest-req"></a>;</li>
					<li>it adheres to the construction requirements defined in <a href="#wp-construction"></a>.</li>

		<section id="infoset">
			<h2>Information Set</h2>

			<p class="ednote">As the serialization of the manifest remains an open issue, specifics about how properties
				are compiled into the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> remain under-specified. This
				includes, but is not limited to, what specific names the properties will have in the <abbr
					title="information set">infoset</abbr>, whether the names in the <a>manifest</a> will be the same as
				those in the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> and/or whether mappings to properties from
				known vocabularies will be used.</p>

			<p class="issue" data-number="63">The name "<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>" might change
				depending on feedback. Although this term has a different meaning for individuals familiar with <abbr

				not fully capture the nature or purpose of the collected information.</p>

			<section id="infoset-expl" class="informative">
				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is defined by a set of properties known as its <dfn data-lt="infoset"
						>information set</dfn> (<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>). The <abbr
						title="information set">infoset</abbr> is logically divided into two sets of properties: those
					that describe the publication and those that express key structures. These classifications only
					exist for the purposes of understanding the function of the properties, however.</p>

				<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the
					sense that it represents a set of information that a user agent has to compile about the Web
					Publication, but it also becomes concrete when the user agent creates an internal representation of
					that information.</p>

				<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is primarily compiled from a Web Publication's
						<a>manifest</a>, whose serialization requirements are defined in <a
						href="#manifest-serialization"></a>. Some information can be obtained outside the
					manifest—fallback rules for properties defined in the following subsections allow a user agent to
					compile information that the author has not provided in the manifest, for example.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="infoset-req">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>

				<p>The requirements for the expression of <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> properties
					are as follows:</p>

				<h3>Descriptive Properties</h3>

				<section id="wp-a11y">
					<h4>Accessibility</h4>

					<p>Accessibility metadata allows the discovery of features and affordances of the <a>Web
							Publication</a> that enable its use by users with different reading requirements and
						needs.</p>

					<p class="ednote">How to express accessibility metadata remains to be determined. This could be a
						grouping of <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility">properties from
							schema.org</a>, for example, or could be split out into a list of individual properties.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-address">
					<h4>Address</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>address</dfn> is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>&#160;[[!url]] that
						represents the primary entry page for the Web Publication. If this URL does not resolve to an
							<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document&#160;[[!html]], user agents
						SHOULD NOT provide access to it to users.</p>

					<p>The referenced document SHOULD be a resource of the Web Publication. It can be any resource,
						including one that is not listed in the <a>default reading order</a>. This document MUST include
						a <a href="#wp-linking">link to the manifest</a> to ensure a bidirectional linking relationship
						(i.e., that user agents can also locate the manifest from the document at the address.</p>

					<p>If the document is not a Web Publication resource, user agents SHOULD load the first document in
						the <a>default reading order</a> when initiating the Web Publication.</p>

					<p class="note">To improve the usability of Web Publications, particularly in user agents that do
						not support Web Publications, include navigation aids in the referenced document that facilitate
						consumption of the content, (e.g., provide a table of contents or a link to one).</p>

					<p>The availability of the address does not preclude the creation and use of other identifiers
						and/or addresses to retrieve a <a>Web Publication</a>, whether in whole or
						in part.</p>

					<div class="note">The Web Publication's address can also be used as value for an identifier link
						relation&#160;[[link-relation]].</div>

				</section>

				<section id="wp-canonical-identifier">
					<h4>Canonical Identifier</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>canonical identifier</dfn> is a unique identifier that resolves to the preferred version of
						the Web Publication. The canonical identifier MUST be an <a>address</a> or a value that allows a
						one-to-one mapping to an address (e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier"
						>DOI</abbr>&#160;[[doi]] can be resolved to a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
						>URL</abbr>&#160;[[url]] via a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> resolver). If
						a user agent cannot resolve the canonical identifier to an address, it SHOULD ignore the
						property.</p>

					<p>If a Web Publication is hosted at more than one address, the canonical identifier allows a user
						agent to identify the shared relationship between the versions and to determine which of the
						available addresses is primary.</p>

					<p>The canonical identifier is also intended to provide a measure of permanence above and beyond the
						Web Publication's <a>address</a>. Even if a Web Publication is permanently relocated to a new
						address, for example, the canonical identifier will provide a way of locating the new location
						(e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> registry could be updated with the
						new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or a redirect could be added to the <abbr
							title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the canonical identifier).</p>

					<p>When assigned, the canonical identifier needs to be unique to one and only one Web Publication,
						independent of its address(es). Ensuring uniqueness is outside the scope of this specification,
						however. The actual uniqueness achievable depends on such factors as the conventions of the
						identifier scheme used and the degree of control over assignment of identifiers.</p>

					<p class="note">If the canonical identifier is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
						it can be used as the target of a "canonical" link&#160;[[rfc6596]] (e.g., a <code>link</code>
						element&#160;[[html]] whose <code>rel</code> attribute has the value <code>canonical</code> or
						an <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>
						<code>Link</code> header field&#160;[[rfc5988]] similarly identified).</p>

					<p class="issue" data-number="58">Is a canonical identifier necessary to call out explicitly in the
							<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>, or can it be handled by other metadata.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-cover">
					<h4>Cover</h4>

					<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> SHOULD include a reference to a cover image.
						This image can be used by user agents to present the <a>Web Publication</a> to users (e.g., in a
						library or bookshelf, or when initially loading the Web Publication).</p>

					<p>User agents SHOULD NOT use the cover image as the sole means of selecting or accessing Web
						Publications. A user agent SHOULD use the Web Publication's <a href="#wp-title">title</a> and <a
							href="#wp-creators">creators</a> as text alternatives for such interfaces.</p>

					<p>More than one cover image MAY be referenced from the infoset to provide alternative sizes and
						resolutions for different device screens.</p>

					<p>A user agent MAY create a cover for a Web Publication if one is not present. This specification
						does not define requirements for the creation of such cover images (e.g., the user agent could
						use a placeholder image, generate an image dynamically, or incorporate properties of the infoset
						into a graphic, such as the title or creators).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-creators">
					<h4>Creators</h4>

					<p>Creators are the individuals or entities responsible for the creation of the <a>Web
							Publication</a>.</p>

					<p>The creator property SHOULD include the role the creator played in the creation of the Web

					<p>The Web Publication's <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> MAY contain global language

			<h2>Web Publication Lifecycle</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>The publishing working group is currently evaluating the best approach for implementing <a>Web
						Publications</a> in user agents. This note is intended to provide an overview of where current
					thinking is at and what issues are under consideration.</p>

				<p>The development of Web Publications is not viewed as a separate forking of the Web, but an
					enhancement layer that can be supported by user agents. To that end, the primary constraints on any
					solution for Web Publications are that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the rendering of Web Publications must not interfere with the underlying Web model and <abbr
							title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> &#8212; all functionality and
						enhancements must be layered on top;</li>
					<li>a Web Publication should not have to carry its own implementation code &#8212; functionality is
						ideally provided by the user agent and/or polyfill.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While this specification will provide implementation flexibility for user agents, there are still a
					number of areas that have been identified as potentially needing to be detailed. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>initialization expectations for a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>automatic initiation v. user prompts;</li>
							<li>linked v. directly loaded manifests;</li>
							<li>resources that belong to more than one Web Publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>the creation of a "publication state":</p>
						<ul>
							<li>persistence of publication information across page loads;</li>
							<li>location and persistence of UI;</li>
							<li>indications of supported features;</li>
							<li>DOM issues such as persistence of numbering schemes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>tracking the extent of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>taking an entire publication offline;</li>
							<li>enabling search across documents.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>establishing the bounds of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>when to end the publication state;</li>
							<li>document history traversal;</li>
							<li>how to handle links outside the publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>updating of the <a>manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The working group intends to flesh out the lifecycle in later revisions once it is clearer what
					models are viable and what solutions can be standardized. Input on the feasibility and challenges of
					these approaches is welcome at any time.</p>

					<h4>Layout</h4>

					<p>The layout and rendering of <a>Web Publications</a> is governed by the same rules that apply to
						all Web content: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents are styled and
						laid out according to the rules of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, SVG
						documents are rendered as defined by that format, etc. This specification requires no particular
						profile or subset of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr
							title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics"
							>SVG</abbr> to be supported, other than the expectations set for these technologies by their
						respective specifications.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This specification intentionally avoids introducing any new layout features. Any shortcoming
							of the Web platform in terms of layout needs to be addressed for the whole Web platform,
							which means via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

						<p>This working group will work with other relevant groups of the <abbr
								title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to address platform-wide limitations that
							negatively impact <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>For the purposes of layout, each resource of a Web Publication is treated as a separate document.
						User agents MUST NOT mix content from multiple resources in the same rendering (e.g., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS floats</a> or <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#absolutely-positioned">absolutely positioned
							elements</a> from one resource cannot intrude or overlap with content from an other
						resource).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Despite this general requirement that each resource should be treated as a separate document
							for the purpose of layout, there are some places where <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"
								>CSS</abbr> specifications should be amended to be able to deal more intelligently with
							collections of resources like <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>

						<p>One instance is the definition of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-content/#cross-references">cross-references</a>,
							which are currently restricted to work only within a single document. This restriction
							should be relaxed to allow for cross-references between separate resources of a single Web
							Publication.</p>

						<p>Another related would be to allow <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#counter-properties">counters</a> to
							accumulate across multiple resources of a single Web Publication (e.g., so that figures in
							multiple sections may be numbered in a single sequence).</p>
					</div>

				</section>

				<section id="aff-user-settings">
					<h4>User Settings</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a>, it SHOULD provide user settings to customize
						the experience.</p>

					<p>User settings MAY include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>text size;</li>
						<li>font family;</li>
						<li>display mode (night, high contrast, etc.);</li>
						<li>playback speed (for audio and video resources).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This specification does not cover how user agents override author styles to offer user
						settings.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To provide user settings in their reader mode, browsers usually get rid of most of the author
							styles. There is always a tension in reading environments between author styles and the
							user's preference, which is very hard to balance.</p>

				<section id="scrolling-or-paginating" class="informative">
					<h4>Scrolling or Paginating</h4>

					<p>Publications have historically been presented via paged media, whereas Web pages almost always
						scroll. As the preferences of individual readers vary, and as different types of publications
						are better suited for one or the other, this specification encourages user agents to support
						both, and to offer a choice to their users.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>It might be useful for authors to be able to specify a preference between scrolling and
							pagination, even if a strict requirement is not possible. This should most likely be
							addressed through an extension of <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt-1/#atviewport-rule"
								><code>@viewport</code></a> or of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta">the viewport meta
								tag</a>(see&#160;[[css-device-adapt]]), or possibly through an extension of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#at-page-rule"><code>@page</code></a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). This should be discussed with the relevant working groups (<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSSWG</a>, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">WebPlatformWG</a>, <a

				</section>

				<section id="aff-pagination">
					<h4>Paginated Layout</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a> in a paginated layout, it MUST lay out each
						document in the <a>default reading order</a> sequentially, with the last page of a resource
						being followed by the first page of the subsequent one.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To avoid blank pages, if a resource ends on a left page (resp. right page), the subsequent
							one should start on a right page (resp. left page) even if the <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]) would otherwise lead to it starting on the opposite page. It
							should also be possible to use the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before">break-before</a> property
							(see&#160;[[!css-break-3]]) to force the content to resume on the opposite side if that was
							desired by the author.</p>

						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended to describe this exception to the general behavior when
							dealing with collections of documents instead of individual documents.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="ednote">
						<p>How is pagination supposed to work when subsequent resources have opposite <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> directions
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). For example, due to different a different writing mode? This is
							not necessarily a problem from a layout point of view, as each page is independent, but from
							an UI point of view. If swiping left means next page until the end of one chapter, and
							starts meaning previous page in the next chapter because the language is switched from
							English to Hebrew, this is going to be confusing.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended so that <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#page-based-counters">page counters</a> are
							not automatically reset to at the beginning of each new resource belonging to the same Web
							Publication.</p>

				<h3>Navigation</h3>

				<p class="issue" data-number="86"></p>

				<section id="aff-reading-order">
					<h4>Reading Order</h4>

					<p>Hyperlinks are the means by which multiple resources are linked together on the Web. When users
						reach the end of one resource, they have to activate a hyperlink to move to the next resource in
						the sequence. While this model of navigation is effective, it is also disruptive for immersive
						reading &#8212; it forces users to disengage from the content and perform the actions necessary
						to activate the links. It is also limited to media types that support hyperlinks.</p>

					<p>The <a>default reading order</a> provides an enhancement to the hyperlink model, allowing the
						user agent to automatically move the user to the next resource when a more natural action
						occurs, like a swipe across the screen. It is similar conceptually and functionally to the
							<code>link</code> element's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#sec-link-types"
								><code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> relationships</a>&#160;[[!html]].</p>

					<p>User agents SHOULD provide an affordance that saves this progression in the publication and
						returns the user to their last location the next time they open the publication.</p>

					<p>When the user agent <a>obtains a manifest</a> for the first time, it MAY also prompt the user
						whether they would like to:</p>

			<h3>Web Publication Locators</h3>

			<p class="ednote"> The document referred from this section, i.e., Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]], has been recently renamed. Its previous was "Locators for Web
				Publication". The terminology used in this section has to be realigned with the name change. </p>

			<p>Locators are used to identify, locate, retrieve, and/or reference locations and content fragments within
					<a>Web Publications</a> (e.g., for address(es), bookmarks, and annotations). Locators traditionally
				take the form of fragment identifiers&#160;[[rfc3986]], where the portion of a <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> preceded by a number sign character (<code>#</code>)
				identifies a specific position within the referenced resource.</p>

			<p>For some use cases, it is essential to identify and reference a <a>Web Publication</a> resource—or a
				location in or a segment of a resource—in the scope or context of the Web Publication to which it
				belongs. A traditional fragment identifier cannot satisfy this requirement, since only the <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the constituent resource containing the location or
				content fragment of interest is expressed. The Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]] document, based on the Web Annotation Model&#160;[[!annotation-model]],
				addresses this issue by providing the means to express both the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
					>URL</abbr> of the resource and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the Web
				Publication.</p>

			<p>Web Publication Locators also address the problem of referencing into a resource that was not authored
				with such a need in mind. A fragment identifier can only reference elements with explicit identifiers
				and locations with explicit anchor points. Web Publication Locators include a variety of selectors that
				work with the general structures and content of a resource (e.g., text selectors, <abbr
					title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selectors).</p>

			<p class="ednote">As Web Publication Locators currently rely on a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"
					>JSON</abbr>-based expression syntax, it is not yet clear how much of this syntax can be translated
				to a fragment identifier. This may limit the usefulness beyond expressions that are also <abbr
					title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-based (e.g., outside of annotations or
				bookmarks).</p>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>Illustrate with example of an easy to understand Web Publication Locator, such as might be used in
					annotating a simple Web Publication.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The semantics of Web Publication Locators are a mapping and extension of the Web Annotation Data
				Model&#160;[[annotation-model]] and Vocabulary&#160;[[annotation-vocab]] for describing and referencing
				a segment of a Web resource. As a result, Web Publication Locators provide the expressiveness needed for
				a broad range of annotation and bookmarking use cases. Additionally, Web Publication Locators provide a
				way to identify and reference a location within a Web Publication (i.e., as distinct from identifying
				and referencing a content fragment consisting of a span of characters or bytes). A Web Publication
				Locator can be used to identify, retrieve and/or reference a fragment of a Web Publication that spans
				multiple resources. </p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In composing a Web Publication Locator, use the <a>canonical identifier</a> of the Web Publication in
					preference to any alternative addresses. Such use facilitates the collation of Web Publication
					Locators associated with a particular Web Publication. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators"
						>URLs</abbr> of Web Publication resources appearing in a Web Publication Locator should match
					the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URL</abbr> of the resource provided in the <abbr
						title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>

				<dt id="WP-diagram-descr">Description for the <a href="#WP-diagram">“Structure of Web Publications”
						diagram</a>:</dt>
				<dd>A simplified diagram of the structure of a <a>Web Publication</a>. The Web Publication is broken
					down into two elements. The first element is the actual contents (all the real things listed in the
					manifest). This element is broken down into the CSS, the actual “things” such as the <abbr
						title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, audio, etc, and the images, fonts etc.
					The actual “things” have an additional subset of items that includes the entry page to the
					publication and all of the other documents. The second element is the Manifest (JSON). The manifest
					is used to generate the <a href="#infoset">Information Set (“Infoset”)</a>, which consists of a list
					of all the “things” in the publication, the publication metadata, and the default reading order of
					content. It is noted in the diagram that the entry page has to link to the manifest. (<a
						role="doc-backlink" href="#WP-diagram">Return to the diagram</a> of Web Publication.)</dd>
