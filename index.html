			<p>This first public working draft provides a preliminary outline of a Web Publication. Many details are under
				active consideration within the Publishing Working Group and are subject to change. The most prominent known
				issues have been identified in this document and links provided to comment on them.</p>

			<p>In particular, the Working Group seeks feedback on the following issues:</p>

				<li>...</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="intro" class="informative">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section>
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>For millenia now, the written word has been the primary means of encoding and sharing ideas and
					information. The publication as a bounded edition, made public, has been used to carry intellectual and
					artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals, magazines, newspapers, articles,
					laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos, manuals, and albums of all
					sorts.</p>

				<p>More recently, with the advent of the information age, print has been ceding ground to digital, and the
					Web has become a major forum for the public dissemination of ideas. But the Web is unbounded: information
					and resources are only loosely connected through hyperlinks. While this model has helped the Web thrive
					in many areas, it has proven problematic for traditional information publishing—users often cannot access
					works in their entirety, especially when offline, and have not been able to easily access, compile and
					download content for curation and personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of
					non-Web document formats to redress these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready
					content and alternative offline renditions to ensure publications are fully available.</p>

				<p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
					of both models—the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
					accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
					that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
					work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>
			</section>

			<!-- <section id="nature">
				<h3>Web Publications</h3>

				<p>The act of publishing involves obtaining resources, organizing them into a publication and making that
					publication available on a Web server. In doing so, the publisher establishes the interconnectedness that
					binds the resources into a single work. This process also provides an origin for the Web Publication and
					a URL that uniquely identifies it, giving provenance to the work.</p>

				<p>The establishment of this discoverable and identifiable collection is what enables users to access their
					content without concern for whether they are online or offline. The user agent can cache the resources
					ensuring that the Web Publication is available and functional while offline, providing the user, as much
					as possible, a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network
					connection.</p>

				<p>The Web Publication introduces the concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the
					constituent resources of the publication. The manifest includes metadata that describes the publication
					as a whole, as it has an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources. The metadata and manifest
					also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication also provides a default ordering of its primary constituent resources, although that
					order may be changed by user interaction or scripting. The user is able to access any primary resource
					directly via navigation provided by the publication itself or via the user agent.</p>

			<section id="terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>Wherever appropriate, this document relies on the terminology defined by the note on “Publishing and Linking on the Web” [[publishing-linking]]. In particular, the terms that are very important for this document include <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user">user</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-browser">browser</a>, or <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-address">address</a>.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><dfn>URL</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							In this specification, the general term URL is used as in other W3C specifications like HTML&nbsp;[[html]], and is defined by URL Standard of the WhatWG&nbsp;[[url]].
							In particular, such a URL allows for the usage of characters from Unicode following&nbsp;[[rfc3987]].
							See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/references.html#biblio-url">the note in the HTML5 document</a> for further details.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Default Reading Order</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							The default reading order is a specific progression through the <a>primary resources</a> defined in the <a>manifest</a> by the creator of a <a>Web Publication</a>.
						</p>

						<p>
							A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such interaction the default reading order defines the expected progression from one primary resource to the next.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Primary Resources">Primary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A primary resource is one that is listed in the <a>default reading order</a> of a <a>Web Publication</a>.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Secondary Resources">Secondary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A secondary resource is one that is required for the processing or rendering of a <a>primary resource</a>.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Manifests">Manifest</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A manifest represents structured information about a <a>Web Publication</a>, such as informative metadata, a list of all <a data-lt="primary resource">primary</a> and <a>secondary resources</a>, and a <a>default reading order</a>.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="WP|Web Publications">Web Publication</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A Web Publication is a collection of one or more <a>primary resources</a>, organized together through a <a>manifest</a> into a single logical work with a <a>default reading order</a>.
							The Web Publication	is uniquely identifiable and presentable using Open Web Platform technologies.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Identifier|WP Identifier">(Persistent) Identifier</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							An identifier is metadata that can be used to refer to a <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-web-content">Web Content</a> in a persistent and unambiguous manner.
							URLs, URNs, DOIs, ISBNs, or PURLs are all examples of identifiers frequently used in publishing.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="WP Address">Web Publication Address</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A Web Publication Address is a <a>URL</a> that refers to a <a>Web Publication</a> and enables the retrieval of a representation of the <a>manifest</a> of the <a>Web Publication</a>.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="WP Canonical Identifier|canonical identifier">Web Publication Canonical Identifier</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							A Web Publication canonical identifier is an <a>identifier</a> assigned to a <a>Web Publication</a> by the publisher.
							It SHOULD either be a <a>Web Publication Address</a>, or it MUST be possible to make a 1-to-1 mapping to a <a>Web Publication Address</a>.
							If it is URL, it MAY be used as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute of a canonical link element (i.e., a <code>link</code> element with a <code>rel='canonical'</code> attribute&nbsp;[[rfc6596]]).

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication is conformant to this specification if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST have at least one <a>primary resource</a>.</li>
					<li>It MUST have a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to all normative requirements defined in <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p id="ua-conformance">A user agent is conformant to this specification if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST be capable of processing and interpreting the manifest, as defined in <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>.</li>

			<section>
				<h2>Abstract versus Concrete Manifest</h2>

				<p>This specification defines the content of a <a>manifest</a> on two levels.</p>

				<ul>
					<p>
						An <dfn>abstract manifest</dfn> is defined to identify what type of information is necessary at the <a>Web Publication</a> level (as opposed to individual resource level) for a user agent to process the publication properly.
					</p>

					<p>
						The <dfn>concrete manifest</dfn> defines the file format(s), encodings, etc., used to represent the <a>abstract manifest</a>, and how those file(s) can be accessed. The same <a>abstract manifest</a> MAY be expressable via different concrete manifest formats.
					</p>
				</ul>

				<p class="ednote">As discussed on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2017/2017-08-14-minutes">group teleconference on the 2017-08-14</a>, the separation of these two terms may be temporary, and subsequent editorial passes may merge the two notions.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="abstractmanifest">The abstract manifest</h2>

				<p>An <a>abstract manifest</a> should contain the following information.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>It MUST assert WP-ness.</li>
					<li>
						It MUST include a <a>Web Publication Address</a>.
						Availability of this address does not preclude the creation and use of other identifiers and/or addresses to retrieve a representation of a <a>Web Publication</a> in whole or part.
					</li>					
					<li>It MUST list the <a>Primary Resources</a> of the WP in their default reading order.</li>
					<li>It SHOULD list <a>Secondary Resources</a>, although that list is not necessarily exhaustive.</li>
					<li>
						It SHOULD include a <a>Canonical Identifier</a>.
						If assigned, this <a>Canonical Identifier</a> MUST be unique to the <a>Web Publication</a>.
					</li>
					<li>It SHOULD include a title (or “name”).</li>
					<li>It SHOULD indicate the default (natural) language.</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="note">The <a>Web Publication Address</a> is needed for fulfilling <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/#r_single">Requirement 7</a> and <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/#r_component-change">Requirement 21</a> of the Web Publication UCR.</div>
				<div class="note">The <a>Web Publication Address</a> can also be used as value for an identifier link relation [[link-relation]].</div>

					<p>Note that this is the question for the <a>abstract manifest</a>. How that information is acquired may also depend on the <a href="#fallback">fallback mechanism</a>. </p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="21">
					Whether the minimum manifest must include any metadata, or a specific slot to handle metadata

			<section id="fallback">
				<h3>Fallback mechanisms</h3>

				<p>In some cases, some manifest items, even if required for an <a>abstract manifest</a>, are not necessarily expressed in a <a>concrete manifest</a> explicitly. For some of these cases “fallback mechanisms” are defined, i.e., simple algorithms whereby a <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a> can reconstruct the manifest item. These are:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>title</dt>
					<dd>If the title is not specified in the concrete manifest, a user agent MUST:
						<ul>
							<li>
								if a WP contains a single primary resource with a <code>title</code> element appropriate for its type (e.g., SVG or HTML titles), then that becomes the WP’s title;
							</li>
							<li>
								otherwise, if a WP contains several primary resources with title elements appropriate for their types, the user agent uses the title of the first resource in the <a>default reading order</a>;
							</li>
							<li>
								otherwise, the UA uses its own heuristics.
								Note that a URL or a filename is not considered to be a valid title.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>(natural) language</dt>
					<dd>If the language is not specified in the concrete manifest, a user agent MUST:
						<ul>
							<li>
								if a WP contains a single primary resource with a language element appropriate for its type (e.g., SVG or HTML language tags), then that becomes the WP’s language;
							</li>
							<li>
								otherwise, if a WP contains several primary resources with a language element appropriate for their types, the user agent uses the language of the first resource in the default reading order;
							</li>
							<li>
								otherwise, the language is English.
							</li>
