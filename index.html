			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="what-is-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>What is a Web Publication</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information
					about the Web Publication is expressed in a machine-readable document called a <a>manifest</a>,
					which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection
					between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describe the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity
					and nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources
					that belong to the Web Publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources
					into a single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable in one of two ways: resources either include a link to the manifest
					(via an HTTP Link header or an HTML <code>link</code> element&#160;[[html]]), or the manifest can be
					loaded directly by a compatible user agent.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored
					specifically for their unique reading needs.</p>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the
					way that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type
					of work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the
					consumption of Web Publications. While a primary goal is that traditional Web user agents (browsers)
					will be able to consume Web Publications, this should not limit the capabilities of any other
					possible type of user agent (e.g., applications, whether standalone or running within a user agent,
					or even Web Publications that include their own user interface). As a result, the specification does
					not attempt to architect required solutions for situations whose expected outcome will vary
					depending on the nature of the user agent and the expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to
					initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how much of a Web Publication to cache for offline
					use).</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined by the W3C Note "Publishing and Linking on the

						<p>An identifier is metadata that can be used to refer to <a class="externalDFN"
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-web-content">Web Content</a> in a
							persistent and unambiguous manner. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>,

					<dt><dfn>Non-empty</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>For the purposes of this specification, non-empty is used to refer to an element, attribute

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication conforms to this specification if it meets the following

			<h2>Web Publication Construction</h2>

			<section id="wp-infoset-manifest" class="informative">
				<h3>Infoset and Manifest</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is defined by a set of items known as its <dfn data-lt="infoset">information
						set</dfn> (<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>). The <abbr title="information set"
						>infoset</abbr> is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the sense that it represents a
					set of information that a user agent has to compile about the Web Publication, but it also becomes
					concrete when the user agent creates an internal representation of that information.</p>

				<p>A <a>manifest</a>, on the other hand, is a serialization of an <abbr title="information set"
							><a>infoset</a></abbr> created by the author of a <a>Web Publication</a>. The manifest is
					expressed using the JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]] format &#8212; a variant of JSON&#160;[[ecma-404]] for
					expressing linked data. The manifest can be created as a standalone resource or it can be embedded
					within an HTML document.</p>

				<p>Although the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is primarily compiled from a Web
					Publication's <a>manifest</a>, some information is obtained outside the manifest. The table of
					contents, for example, may be referenced from the manifest but is serialized in an HTML
					document.</p>

				<p>This specification describes the requirements for creating both the infoset and manifest. This
					section, in particular, details how to create a manifest, and <a href="#wp-properties">the next</a>
					lists the various properties common to infosets and manifests.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="webidl">
				<h4>WebIDL</h4>

				<section id="webidl-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Explanation</h4>

					<p>Although a Web Publication manifest is authored as [[json-ld]], user agents process this
						information into an internal data structure representing the <a>infoset</a> in order to utilize
						the properties. The exact manner in which this processing occurs, and how the data is used
						internally, is user agent-dependent.</p>

					<p>To ensure interoperability when exposing the infoset items, this specification defines an
						abstract representation of the data structures using the Web Interface Definition Language
						(WebIDL) [[webidl-1]] which expresses the expected name, datatype, and possible restrictions for
						each member of the manifest expressed in the infoset. (A WebIDL representation can be mapped
						onto ECMAScript, C, or other programming languages.)</p>
				</section>

				<section id="webidl-wpm">
					<h3>The <dfn><code>WebPublicationManifest</code></dfn> Dictionary</h3>

					<pre class="idl" id="wpm">
dictionary WebPublicationManifest {
	
};</pre>

					<p>The <code>WebPublicationManifest</code> dictionary is the [[!webidl-1]] representation of the
						collection of Web Publication manifest properties. WebIDL definitions are also included at the
						beginning of each property that belongs to the dictionary &#8212; these represent the members of
						the <code>WebPublicationManifest</code> dictionary.</p>

					<p class="note">Refer to <a href="#idl-index"></a> for a complete listing of the
							<code>WebPublicationManifest</code> dictionary.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-manifest">
				<h3>Creating a Manifest</h3>

				<section id="manifest-context">
					<h4>Manifest Contexts</h4>

					<p> A Web Publication Manifest MUST start by setting the JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]]. The context
						has the following two major components:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the [[!schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
						<li>the Web Publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context</code></li>
					</ul>

					<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

					<p>The Web Publication context file MAY add features to the properties defined in Schema.org (e.g.,
						the requirement for the <a href="https://schema.org/creator">creator</a> property to be order
						preserving).</p>


					<p class="ednote">As part of the continuous contacts with Schema.org the additional features defined
						in the Web Publication context file could migrate to the core Schema.org vocabulary.</p>

					<p class="note">Although Schema.org is often referenced using the <code>http</code> URI scheme, <a
							href="https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19">the vocabulary is being migrated</a> to use the
						secure <code>https</code> scheme as its default. This specification requires the use
							<code>https</code> when referencing Schema.org in the manifest.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="manifest-values">
					<h4>Values</h4>

					<section id="arrays-and-single-values">
						<h5>Arrays and Single Values</h5>

						<p>Various manifest properties can have one or more values. As a general rule, these values can
							be expressed as [[!json]]&#160; arrays. When the property value is an array with a single
							element, however, the array syntax can be omitted.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of an array">
							<p>As a Web Publication typically contains many resources, this declaration of a single
								resource:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "resources" : "datatypes.svg",
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>is equivalent to the array:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "resources" : ["datatypes.svg"],
    &#8230;
}</pre>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="strings-vs-objects">
						<h5>Text Values or Objects</h5>

						<p>Various manifest properties are expected to be expressed as [[!json]]&#160;objects. Although
							the use of objects is usually RECOMMENDED, it is also acceptable to use string values that
							are interpreted as objects depending on the context. The exact mapping of text values to
							objects is part of the property or object definitions.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of a Person object.">
							<p>The following author name is expressed as a text string:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "author" : "Herman Melville",
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>but, in the context of <a href="#creators">creators</a>, it is equivalent to:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "author" : {
        "type" : "Person"
        "name" : "Herman Melville"
    },
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>(See <a href="#creators"></a> for further details.)</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="link-values">
						<h5>Link Values</h5>

						<p>With the exception of the <a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>, the
							Web Publication properties typically link to one or more resources. When a property requires
							a link value, the link MUST be expressed in one of the following two ways:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>as a string encoding the (absolute or relative) URL of the resources&#160;[[!url]];
								or</li>
							<li>as an instance of a <a href="#publication-link-def"><code>PublicationLink</code>
									object</a> that can be used to express the URL, the media type, and other
								characteristics of the target resource.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>In other words, a single string value is a shorthand for a <code>PublicationLink</code>
							object whose <code>url</code> property is set to that string value. (See also <a
								href="#strings-vs-objects"></a>.)</p>

						<pre class="example" title="Resource list that includes one link using a relative URL as a string ('datatypes.svg') and two that display the various properties of the a PublicationLink object">

				<h3>Embedding a Manifest</h3>

				<p>When opting to embed the manifest, it MUST be included in the <a href="#wp-primary-entry-page"
						>primary entry page</a> using the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element"
							><code>script</code> element</a>&#160;[[!html]]. The <code>type</code> attribute of this
					element MUST be set to <code>application/ld+json</code>.</p>

				<p>Additionally, the <code>script</code> element MUST include a unique identifier in an <code>id</code>
					attribute&#160;[[!html]]. This identifier ensures that the manifest <a href="#wp-linking">can be
						referenced</a>.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="A Web Publication Manifest included in an HTML document">
&lt;script id="example_manifest" type="application/ld+json"&gt;
   {
      &#8230;
   }
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-linking">
				<h2>Linking to a Manifest</h2>

				<p>With the exception of the <a>primary entry page</a>, linking a resource to its Web Publication
					manifest is OPTIONAL. Including a link is encouraged whenever possible, however, as it allows user
					agents to immediately ascertain that a resource belongs to a Web Publication, regardless of how the
					user reaches the resource.</p>

				<p>Links to a Web Publication manifest MUST take one or both of the following forms:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><p>An HTTP <code>Link</code> header field&#160;[[!rfc5988]] with its <code>rel</code> parameter
							set to the value "<code>publication</code>".</p>
						<pre class="example">Link: &lt;https://example.com/webpub/manifest>; rel=publication</pre>
					</li>
					<li><p>A <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!html]] with its <code>rel</code> attribute set to the
							value "<code>publication</code>".</p>
						<pre class="example">&lt;link href="https://example.com/webpub/manifest" rel="publication"/></pre>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>When a manifest is embedded within an HTML document, the link MUST include a fragment identifier that
					references the <code>script</code> element that contains the manifest (see <a
						href="#manifest-embedding"></a>). </p>

				<pre class="example" title="Link to a manifest within the same HTML resource">
	&lt;link href="#example_manifest" rel="publication"&gt;
	&#8230;
	&lt;script id="example_manifest" type="application/ld+json"&gt;
	{
        "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
        &#8230;
	}
	&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

				<p class="issue" data-number="132">The exact value of <code>rel</code> is still to be agreed upon and
					should be registered by IANA.</p>

				<p class="ednote">The following details might be moved to the lifecycle section in a future draft.</p>

				<p>When a resource links to multiple manifests, a user agent MAY choose to present one or more
					alternatives to the end user, or choose a single alternative on its own. The user agent MAY choose
					to present any manifest based upon information that it possesses, even one that is not explicitly
					listed as a parent (e.g., based upon information it calculates or acquires out of band). In the
					absence of a preference by user agent implementers, selection of the first manifest listed is
					suggested as a default.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="wp-bounds">
				<h2>Web Publication Bounds</h2>

				<p>A Web Publication consists of a finite set of <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> that represent
					its content. This extent is known as its bounds and is defined within its manifest &#8212; it is
					obtained from the union of resources listed in the <a href="#default-reading-order">default reading
						order</a> and <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a>.</p>

				<p>To determine whether a resource is within the bounds of a Web Publication, user agents MUST compare
					the absolute URL of a resource to the absolute URLs of the resources obtained from the union. If the
					resource is identified in the enumeration, it is within the bounds of the Web Publication. All other
					resources are external to the Web Publication.</p>

				<p>Resources within the bounds of a Web Publication do not have to share the same domain.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-resources">
				<h2>Resources</h2>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> MUST include at least one <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language"
						>HTML</abbr> document&#160;[[!html]]&#8212;the <a>primary entry page</a>.</p>

				<p>There are no restrictions on a Web Publication beyond this requirement. The Web Publication MAY
					include references to resources of any media type, both in the <a>default reading order</a> and as
					dependencies of other resources.</p>

				<p class="note">When adding resources to a Web Publication, consider support in user agents. The use of
					progressive enhancement techniques and the provision of fallback content, as appropriate, will
					ensure a more consistent reading experience for users regardless of their preferred user agent.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-primary-entry-page">
				<h3>Primary Entry Page</h3>

				<p>The <dfn>primary entry page</dfn> is a key [[!HTML]] document required of every Web Publication. It
					represents the preferred starting <a href="#wp-resources">resource</a> for discovery of the Web
					Publication and enables discovery of the <a>manifest</a>.</p>

				<p>Although any resource can link to the Web Publication manifest, the primary entry page typically
					introduces the publication and provides access to the content. It might contain all the content, in
					the case of a single-page Web Publication, or provide navigational aids to begin reading a
					multi-document Web Publication. To facilitate the user ease of consumption, the primary entry page
					SHOULD contain the <a href="#wp-table-of-contents">table of contents</a>.</p>

				<p>It is not required that the primary entry page be included in the <a href="default-reading-order"
						>default reading order</a>, nor that it be the first document listed when it is included. This
					specification leaves the exact nature of the document intentionally underspecified to provide
					flexibility for different approaches (e.g., the primary entry page could be a marketing document for
					the Web Publication instead of a specific page of content). If a default reading order is not
					provided, however, the primary entry page will be used as the default entry.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page is the only resource in which <a href="#manifest-embedding">a manifest MAY be
						embedded</a>. To ensure discovery of the manifest, the primary entry page MUST provide a <a
						href="#wp-linking">link to the manifest</a>, regardless of whether the manifest is embedded
					within the page or external to it.</p>

				<p>The address of the primary entry page is also the <a>canonical identifier</a> for the Web Publication
					(i.e., it serves as the unique identifier for the Web Publication).</p>

				<p>In certain cases where information has been omitted from the manifest, user agents will sometimes use
					the primary entry page as a fallback source of information (see <a href="#language-and-dir">language
						and base direction</a> and <a href="#title">title</a>).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-table-of-contents">
				<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

				<p>The table of contents provides a hierarchical list of links that reflects the structural outline of
					the major sections of the Web Publication.</p>

				<p> The table of contents is expressed via an HTML element (typically a <code>nav</code>
					element&#160;[[!html]]) in one of the <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a>. This element MUST be
					identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
					"<code>doc-toc</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document with
					that <code>role</code> value in <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document
						tree order</a>&#160;[[!dom]]. </p>

				<p>If the table of contents is not located in the <a href="#wp-primary-entry-page">primary entry
						page</a>, the manifest SHOULD <a href="#table-of-contents-manifest">identify the resource</a>
					that contains the structure.</p>

				<p>There are no requirements on the table of contents itself, except that, when specified, it MUST
					include a link to at least one <a href="#wp-resources">resource</a>.</p>

				<p>Refer to the <a href="#table-of-contents">table of contents property definition</a> for more
					information on how to identify in the infoset and manifest which resource contains the table of
					contents.</p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="291">Do we need a more detailed definition for the HTML TOC format?</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-pagelist">
				<h3>Page List</h3>

				<p> The page list is a list of links that provides navigation to static page demarcation points within
					the content. These locations allow users, for example, to coordinate access into the content. The
					exact nature of these locations is left to content creators to define. They usually correspond to
					pages of a print document which is the source of the digital publication, but might be a purely
					digital creation added for the sake of easing navigation. </p>

				<p> The page list is expressed via an HTML element (typically a <code>nav</code> element&#160;[[!html]])
					in one of the <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a>. This element MUST be identified by the
						<code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
					"<code>doc-pagelist</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document
					with that <code>role</code> value <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document
						tree order</a>&#160;[[!dom]]. </p>

				<p> If the page list is not located in the <a href="#wp-primary-entry-page">primary entry page</a>, the
					manifest SHOULD <a href="#page-list-manifest">identify the resource</a> that contains the structure. </p>

				<p> There are no requirements on the page list itself, except that, when specified, it MUST include a
					link to at least one <a href="#wp-resources">resource</a>. </p>

				<p> Refer to the <a href="#page-list"><code>pagelist</code> property definition</a> for more information

			<h2>Web Publication Properties</h2>

			<section id="properties-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Both the Web Publication infoset and manifest are defined by a common set of properties that describe
					the basic information a user agent requires to process and render a Web Publication. These
					properties are categorized as followed:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Descriptive properties describe aspects of a Web Publication, such as its <a href="#wp-title"
								>title</a>, <a href="#creators">creator</a>, and <a href="#language-and-dir"
								>language</a>. These properties are primarily drawn from <a href="https://schema.org"
								>Schema.org</a> and its <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">hosted
								extensions</a>&#160;[[schema.org]], so they map to one or several Schema.org properties
							and inherit their syntax and semantics. (The following property categories typically do not
							have Schema.org equivalents, so are defined specifically for Web Publications.)</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#resource-categorization-properties">resource categorization</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Resource categorization properties describe or identify common sets of resources, such as the
								<a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order">default
								reading order</a>. These properties refer to one or more external resources (images,
							script files, separate metadata files, etc.).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#informative-properties">informative properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Informative properties identify resources that contain additional information about the Web
							Publication, such as its <a href="#privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> or an <a
								href="#accessibility-report">accessibility report</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#structural-properties">structural properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Structural properties identify key meta structures of the Web Publication, such as the <a
								href="#cover">cover image</a>, or the location of the <a href="#table-of-contents">table
								of contents</a> or the <a href="#page-list">pagelist</a>.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>


				<p class="note">The categorization of properties is done to simplify comprehension of their purpose; the
					groupings have no relevance outside this specification (i.e., the groupings do not exist in the
					infoset or manifest).</p>


				<div class="note">
					<p>Each manifest item drawn from schema.org identifies the property it maps to and includes its
						defining type in parentheses. Properties are often available in many types, however, as a result
						of the schema.org inheritance model. Refer to each property definition for more detailed
						information about where it is valid to use.</p>

					<p>Schema.org additionally includes a large number of properties that, though relevant for
						publishing, are not mentioned in this specification &#8212; Web Publication authors can use any
						of these properties. This document defines only the minimal set of infoset items.</p>
				</div>

				<p class="ednote">There are discussion on whether a best practices document would be created, referring

						to a new URL, for example, the canonical identifier provides a way of discovering the new
						location (e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> registry could be updated
						with the new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or a redirect could be added to
						the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the canonical identifier). It is also
						intended to provide a means of identifying instances of the same Web Publication hosted at
						different URLs.</p>

					<h4>Language and Base Direction</h4>

					<p>The <a>Web Publication</a> has a natural language value (e.g., English, French, Chinese), as well
						as a natural base writing direction (the display direction, either left-to-right or
						right-to-left). The <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> has entries to set these
						values, which can influence, for example, the behavior of a user agent (e.g., it might place a
						pop-up for a table of contents on the right hand side for publications whose natural base
						direction is right-to-left).</p>

					<p>Similarly, each natural language property value in the <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> (e.g., <a href="#wp-title">title</a>, <a
							href="#creators">creators</a>) is <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/string-meta/#dom-localizable"
						>localizable</a>&#160;[[string-meta]], meaning that the same information is available for
						each.</p>

					<p>As a result, the <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> has entries to set:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the natural <dfn>language</dfn>, and </li>
						<li>the <dfn>base direction</dfn></li>
					</ul>

					<p>of both the <a>Web Publication</a> (<code>inLanguage</code> and <code>inDirection</code>) and the
						natural language properties values of the <abbr title="information set"
						><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>


					<section id="language-and-dir-infoset">
						<h5>Infoset Requirements</h5>

						<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> MAY contain global language and base
							direction declarations for the Web Publication. The natural language MUST be a tag that
							conforms to&#160;[[!bcp47]], while the <dfn data-lt="TextDirection">base language
								direction</dfn> MUST have one of the following values:</p>

						<ul data-dfn-for="TextDirection">
							<li><code><dfn>ltr</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly
								directionally set to left-to-right text;</li>
							<li><code><dfn>rtl</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly
								directionally set to right-to-left text;</li>
							<li><code><dfn>auto</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly
								directionally set to the direction of the first character with a strong
								directionality.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>When specified, these properties are also used as defaults for textual values in the <abbr
								title="information set">infoset</abbr>.</p>

						<p class="note">It is important to differentiate the language <em>of the publication</em> from
							the language and the base direction of the individual resources that compose it. If such
							resources are, for example, in HTML, the language and direction need to be set in those
							resources, too. The language and base direction of the publication are not inherited.</p>

						<p>The global language information MAY be overridden by individual values.</p>

						<p>When using Web Publication manifests with bidirectional text, user agents SHOULD identify the
							base direction of any given natural language value by scanning the text for the first strong
							directional character. Once the base direction has been identified, user agents MUST
							determine the appropriate rendering and display of natural language values according to the
							Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm&#160;[[!bidi]]. This could require wrapping additional
							control characters or markup around the string prior to display, in order to apply the base
							direction. (See <a href="#app-bidi-examples"></a>.) </p>

						<p class="issue"> This section, in particular the features related to text directions, must be
							reviewed by I18N experts. </p>

						<p>If the manifest is <a href="#manifest-embedding">embedded</a> in the primary entry page via a
								<code>script</code> element, and the manifest does not set the global language and/or
							the base direction (see <a href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir"></a>), the
								<code>lang</code> and the <code>dir</code> attributes of the <code>script</code> element
							are used as the global <a>language</a> and <a>base direction</a>, respectively (see the
							details on handling the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-lang-and-xmllang-attributes"
									><code>lang</code></a> and <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-dir-attribute"><code>dir</code></a>
							attributes in&#160;[[!html]]).</p>

						<p class="issue">It is to be discussed whether this last paragraph, i.e., inheriting values from
								<code>script</code>, should be kept.</p>

						<p>If a user agent requires the language and one is not available in the <abbr
								title="information set">infoset</abbr> (globally, or specifically for that property), or
							the obtained value is invalid, the user agent MAY attempt to determine the language. This
							specification does not mandate how such a language tag is created. The user agent might:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>use the <a>non-empty</a> language declaration of the manifest;</li>
							<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default
									reading order</a>;</li>
							<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p> No default values are specified for the <a>language</a> or the default <a>base
							direction</a>. </p>

				<h4>Generating a Canonical Manifest</h4>

				<p> A <dfn data-lt="canonical manifest|canonical web publication manifest">Canonical Web Publication
						Manifest</dfn> (or Canonical Manifest) is a version of the Web Publication <a>Manifest</a> where
					all possible ambiguities on property values (see, e.g., <a href="#arrays-and-single-values"></a> or
						<a href="#strings-vs-objects"></a>) have been removed, and all values that are possibly
					harnessed from the <a>primary entry page</a> are incorporated. Using a Canonical Manifest when <a
						href="#processing-manifest">processing the manifest</a> makes those processing steps, as well as
					the transformation of the manifest to programming language structures, clearer. Converting the
					Manifest into its canonical form is done when the manifest is <a href="#obtaining-manifest"
						>obtained</a>. </p>

				<p> The steps to convert a Web Publication Manifest into a Canonical Manifest are given by the following
					algorithm. The algorithm takes the following arguments:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the <var>manifest</var> the JSON object that represent the <a>manifest</a></li>
					<li>the <var>base</var> URL string, that represents the base URL for the manifest</li>

						<a data-cite="!dom#elementdef-document">HTML Document (DOM) Node</a>, representing the
							<a>primary entry page</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p> The steps of the algorithm are described below. As an abuse of notation, <var>P["term"]</var> refers
					to the value in the object <var>P</var> for the label <var>"term"</var>, where <var>P</var> is
					either <var>manifest</var>, or an object appearing within <var>manifest</var> (e.g., a
						<var>Person</var>). The algorithm replaces or adds some terms to <var>manifest</var>; the
					replacement terms are expressed in JSON syntax as <code class="json">{"term":"value"}</code>. </p>

				<h3>Switch to publication mode</h3>

						<a>publication mode</a>.</p>

				<p>This feature has the following requirements:</p>

				<ol>

					<h4>Layout</h4>

					<p>The layout and rendering of <a>Web Publications</a> is governed by the same rules that apply to
						all Web content: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents are styled and
						laid out according to the rules of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, SVG
						documents are rendered as defined by that format, etc. This specification requires no particular
						profile or subset of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr
							title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics"
							>SVG</abbr> to be supported, other than the expectations set for these technologies by their
						respective specifications.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This specification intentionally avoids introducing any new layout features. Any shortcoming
							of the Web platform in terms of layout needs to be addressed for the whole Web platform,
							which means via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

						<p>This working group will work with other relevant groups of the <abbr
								title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to address platform-wide limitations that
							negatively impact <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>For the purposes of layout, each resource of a Web Publication is treated as a separate document.
						User agents MUST NOT mix content from multiple resources in the same rendering (e.g., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS floats</a> or <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#absolutely-positioned">absolutely positioned
							elements</a> from one resource cannot intrude or overlap with content from an other
						resource).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Despite this general requirement that each resource should be treated as a separate document
							for the purpose of layout, there are some places where <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"
								>CSS</abbr> specifications should be amended to be able to deal more intelligently with
							collections of resources like <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>

						<p>One instance is the definition of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-content/#cross-references">cross-references</a>,
							which are currently restricted to work only within a single document. This restriction
							should be relaxed to allow for cross-references between separate resources of a single Web
							Publication.</p>

						<p>Another related would be to allow <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#counter-properties">counters</a> to
							accumulate across multiple resources of a single Web Publication (e.g., so that figures in
							multiple sections may be numbered in a single sequence).</p>

				</section>

				<section id="feature-user-settings">
					<h4>User Settings</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a>, it SHOULD provide user settings to customize
						the experience.</p>

					<p>User settings MAY include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>text size;</li>
						<li>font family;</li>
						<li>display mode (night, high contrast, etc.);</li>
						<li>playback speed (for audio and video resources).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This specification does not cover how user agents override author styles to offer user
						settings.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To provide user settings in their reader mode, browsers usually get rid of most of the author
							styles. There is always a tension in reading environments between author styles and the
							user's preference, which is very hard to balance.</p>
					</div>

					<p class="issue" data-number="138"></p>
				</section>

				<section id="scrolling-or-paginating" class="informative">
					<h4>Scrolling or Paginating</h4>

					<p>Publications have historically been presented via paged media, whereas Web pages almost always
						scroll. As the preferences of individual readers vary, and as different types of publications
						are better suited for one or the other, this specification encourages user agents to support
						both, and to offer a choice to their users.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>It might be useful for authors to be able to specify a preference between scrolling and
							pagination, even if a strict requirement is not possible. This should most likely be
							addressed through an extension of <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt-1/#atviewport-rule"
								><code>@viewport</code></a> or of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta">the viewport meta

				</section>

				<section id="feature-pagination">
					<h4>Paginated Layout</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a> in a paginated layout, it MUST lay out each
						document in the <a>default reading order</a> sequentially, with the last page of a resource
						being followed by the first page of the subsequent one.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To avoid blank pages, if a resource ends on a left page (resp. right page), the subsequent
							one should start on a right page (resp. left page) even if the <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]) would otherwise lead to it starting on the opposite page. It
							should also be possible to use the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before">break-before</a> property
							(see&#160;[[!css-break-3]]) to force the content to resume on the opposite side if that was
							desired by the author.</p>

						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended to describe this exception to the general behavior when
							dealing with collections of documents instead of individual documents.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="ednote">
						<p>How is pagination supposed to work when subsequent resources have opposite <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> directions
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). For example, due to different a different writing mode? This is
							not necessarily a problem from a layout point of view, as each page is independent, but from
							an UI point of view. If swiping left means next page until the end of one chapter, and
							starts meaning previous page in the next chapter because the language is switched from
							English to Hebrew, this is going to be confusing.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended so that <a

				<h3>Navigation</h3>

					<h4>Reading Order</h4>

					<p>Hyperlinks are the means by which multiple resources are linked together on the Web. When users
						reach the end of one resource, they have to activate a hyperlink to move to the next resource in
						the sequence. While this model of navigation is effective, it is also disruptive for immersive
						reading &#8212; it forces users to disengage from the content and perform the actions necessary
						to activate the links. It is also limited to media types that support hyperlinks.</p>

					<p>The <a>default reading order</a> provides an enhancement to the hyperlink model, allowing the
						user agent to automatically move the user to the next resource when a more natural action
						occurs, like a swipe across the screen. It is similar conceptually and functionally to the
							<code>link</code> element's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#sec-link-types"
								><code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> relationships</a>&#160;[[!html]].</p>

					<p> The user must be able to leave the Web Publication and return to it at the last position they
						left from. The User Agent must retain the reading position, based on the last known position of
						the reader in the web publication. The position should be based on the reader's position in the
						file, within the reading order. </p>
					<p> The user agent may retain reading state if the web publication is revised. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Affordances</h5>
					<p> The navigation of the web publication should be defined in the <a>Default Reading Order</a>
						required by the Information Set. </p>
					<p> User Agents should not have to set the reading state in the following type of resources: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>External Links (i.e. a link to google.com)</li>
						<li>Data references (i.e. a linked CSV file)</li>
						<li>Multimedia content (i.e. a video)</li>
					</ul>

					<p> Reading state should only apply to content documents listed as being within the bounds of the
						Web Publication. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Examples</h5>
					<p> Example 1:<br /> Sarah is reading a long article on her way to work. She arrives before she has
						finished, but wants to continue from the place she left off. The user agent should remember her
						reading state for the next time she opens the publication. </p>

					<h5>Testing</h5>
					<p> If a tester opens a web publication in a WP-aware UA, moves ahead in the publication, closes the
						reader, then reopens it, they should be returned to the last known reading state. </p>

			<h3>Web Publication Locators</h3>

			<p class="ednote"> The document referred from this section, i.e., Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[wpub-ann]], has been recently renamed. Its previous was "Locators for Web
				Publication". The terminology used in this section has to be realigned with the name change. </p>

			<p>Locators are used to identify, locate, retrieve, and/or reference locations and content fragments within
					<a>Web Publications</a> (e.g., for address(es), bookmarks, and annotations). Locators traditionally
				take the form of fragment identifiers&#160;[[rfc3986]], where the portion of a <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> preceded by a number sign character (<code>#</code>)
				identifies a specific position within the referenced resource.</p>

			<p>For some use cases, it is essential to identify and reference a <a>Web Publication</a> resource—or a
				location in or a segment of a resource—in the scope or context of the Web Publication to which it
				belongs. A traditional fragment identifier cannot satisfy this requirement, since only the <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the constituent resource containing the location or
				content fragment of interest is expressed. The Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[wpub-ann]] document, based on the Web Annotation Model&#160;[[annotation-model]],
				addresses this issue by providing the means to express both the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
					>URL</abbr> of the resource and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the Web
				Publication.</p>

			<p>Web Publication Locators also address the problem of referencing into a resource that was not authored
				with such a need in mind. A fragment identifier can only reference elements with explicit identifiers
				and locations with explicit anchor points. Web Publication Locators include a variety of selectors that
				work with the general structures and content of a resource (e.g., text selectors, <abbr
					title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selectors).</p>

			<p class="ednote">As Web Publication Locators currently rely on a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"
					>JSON</abbr>-based expression syntax, it is not yet clear how much of this syntax can be translated
				to a fragment identifier. This may limit the usefulness beyond expressions that are also <abbr
					title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-based (e.g., outside of annotations or
				bookmarks).</p>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>Illustrate with example of an easy to understand Web Publication Locator, such as might be used in
					annotating a simple Web Publication.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The semantics of Web Publication Locators are a mapping and extension of the Web Annotation Data
				Model&#160;[[annotation-model]] and Vocabulary&#160;[[annotation-vocab]] for describing and referencing
				a segment of a Web resource. As a result, Web Publication Locators provide the expressiveness needed for
				a broad range of annotation and bookmarking use cases. Additionally, Web Publication Locators provide a
				way to identify and reference a location within a Web Publication (i.e., as distinct from identifying
				and referencing a content fragment consisting of a span of characters or bytes). A Web Publication
				Locator can be used to identify, retrieve and/or reference a fragment of a Web Publication that spans
				multiple resources. </p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In composing a Web Publication Locator, use the <a>canonical identifier</a> of the Web Publication in
					preference to any alternative addresses. Such use facilitates the collation of Web Publication
					Locators associated with a particular Web Publication. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators"
						>URLs</abbr> of Web Publication resources appearing in a Web Publication Locator should match
					the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URL</abbr> of the resource provided in the <abbr
						title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>

				<dt id="WP-diagram-descr">Description for the <a href="#WP-diagram">“Structure of Web Publications”
						diagram</a>:</dt>
				<dd>A simplified diagram of the structure of a <a>Web Publication</a>. The Web Publication is broken
					down into two elements. The first element is the actual contents (all the real things listed in the
					manifest). This element is broken down into the CSS, the actual “things” such as the <abbr
						title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, audio, etc, and the images, fonts etc.
					The actual “things” have an additional subset of items that includes the entry page to the
					publication and all of the other documents. The second element is the Manifest (JSON). The manifest
					is used to generate the <a href="#wp-infoset-manifest">Information Set (“Infoset”)</a>, which
					consists of a list of all the “things” in the publication, the publication metadata, and the default
					reading order of content. It is noted in the diagram that the entry page has to link to the
					manifest. (<a role="doc-backlink" href="#WP-diagram">Return to the diagram</a> of Web
