			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="why-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>Why Web Publications</h3>

				<p>The Web is a lonely place. It is unbounded: resources live out their lives on remote servers scattered
					across the globe, only reachable by addresses sometimes known to only a few people. But life on the Web
					is not all doom and gloom. Through the power of Web pages, these resources can be brought together to
					create amazing experiences.</p>

				<p>Web sites add another layer of relationship—this time between pages—but the relationship is a tenuous one
					that typically depends on hyperlinks to add cohesion. Without a user that understands how to follow the
					connections, a Web site is still no more than a loose coupling of information.</p>

				<p>The preceding is not a critique of the Web, but meant to highlight that the modern Web is very much an
					active, event-driven experience. Users follow the necessary paths to obtain the information they
					need.</p>

				<p>The traditional publishing model, sometimes called the print model, differs from the Web model in that the
					publisher packages all the information together and thereby establishes the common pathway through it.
					The user can passively follow the content page-by-page, or actively find other pathways via a table of
					contents or index. It is a model that has worked to bind information in a cohesive way for millennia, and
					continues to be an important model alongside the Web. The publication as a bounded edition, made public,
					is used to carry intellectual and artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals,
					magazines, newspapers, articles, laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos,
					manuals, and albums of all sorts.</p>

				<p>Attempts to reproduce this model on the Web, however, have had to work around its loose coupling of
					information: sometimes publications are compressed into a single page; sometimes they are broken across
					multiple pages and hyperlinked together. These models both have flaws, however: single-page publications
					are often so large they render slowly, especially on low-power devices; multi-page publications cannot be
					easily taken offline because their common thread cannot be established.</p>

				<p>As a result, users have had trouble accessing, compiling and downloading Web content for curation and
					personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of non-Web digital formats to redress
					these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready content and alternative renditions for
					offline use.</p>

				<p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
					of both models — the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
					accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform. To do so, it adds an
					unobtrusive definition of interrelation to the Web model: the <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="what-is-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>What is a Web Publication</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of information about a publication
					and its resources. This information is expressed in a machine-readable document called a <a>manifest</a>,
					which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection
					between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describes the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity and
					nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources that
					belong to the Web Publication and the default reading order, which is how it connects resources into a
					single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable in one of two ways: resources either include a link to the manifest (via
					an HTTP Link header or an [[!html]] <code>link</code> element), or the manifest can be loaded directly by
					a compatible user agent.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored specifically
					for their unique reading needs.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
					that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
					work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the consumption of
					Web Publications. While a primary goal is that traditional Web user agents (browsers) will be able to
					consume Web Publications, this should not limit the capabilities of any other possible type of user agent
					(e.g., applications, whether standalone or running within a user agent, or even Web Publications that
					include their own user interface). As a result, the specification does not attempt to architect required
					solutions for situations whose expected outcome will vary depending on the nature of the user agent and
					the expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how
					much of a Web Publication to cache for offline use).</p>

				<h3>Relationship to Other Specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel-wam">
					<h4>Web App Manifest</h4>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>The working group is investigating integration with the work done on [[appmanifest]] to avoid
							duplication of concerns both in the expression and serialization of a manifest and in the
							processing and compilation of the infoset. It is expected, however, that there will be
							differences in the processing models of each (e.g., the initiation of the reading experience for
							web publications versus installation for applications).</p>

						<p>The working assumption is that both applications and publications can use the same manifest and
							serialization to express the information necessary to initiate themselves.</p>

						<p>The initial stage of evaluating this assumption involves:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>the continuing analysis of necessary metadata and publication structure requirements;</li>
							<li>the comparison and harmonization of web publication requirements with those already defined
								in [[appmanifest]].</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The next stage will involve the serialization of the <a>infoset</a> in JSON to see how this
							expression of the manifest can be aligned with the expression of the [[appmanifest]]. Wherever
							semantically possible, the terms used and defined for [[appmanifest]] will be reused, and,
							conversely, some of the members defined for Web Publications may be generally useful for
							applications and may be added to the [[appmanifest]] as a common pool of information. To avoid
							possible future conflicts, care will be taken to use a naming scheme that clearly separates terms
							to be used for Web Publications only.</p>

						<p>This specification consequently should be read and understood in this context of an ongoing
							investigation, and that significant changes may occur in the future.</p>

						<p>This section will be updated with each release to reflect the current status of this work, and
							describe the evolving relationship.</p>

						<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32">issue #32 in the GitHub tracker</a> for
							more discussion about integration.</p>

			<section id="terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>Wherever appropriate, this document relies on terminology defined by the note on "Publishing and Linking
					on the Web" [[!publishing-linking]], including, in particular, <a class="externalDFN"

						<p>An identifier is metadata that can be used to refer to <a class="externalDFN"
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-web-content">Web Content</a> in a

					</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Non-empty</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>For the purposes of this specification, non-empty is used to refer to an element, attribute or

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication is conformant to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it has a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to <a href="#manifest-req"></a>;</li>
					<li>ot adheres to the construction requirements defined in <a href="#wp-construction"></a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p id="ua-conformance">A user agent is conformant to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it is capable of generating a conforming <a href="#infoset">infoset</a> for a Web Publication.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="infoset">
			<h2>Information Set</h2>

			<p class="ednote">The name "infoset" may change depending on feedback. Although this term has a different meaning
				for individuals familiar with XML, alternatives such as "properties" and "metadata" do not fully capture the
				nature or purpose of the collected information. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/63">issue
					#63</a> for discussion.</p>

			<p class="ednote">As the serialization of the manifest remains an open issue, specifics about how properties are
				compiled into the infoset remain unspecified. This includes, but is not limited to, what specific names the
				properties will have in the infoset, whether the names in the manifest will be the same as those in the
				infoset and/or whether mappings to properties from known vocabularies will be used.</p>

			<section id="infoset-expl" class="informative">
				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is defined by a set of properties known as its <dfn data-lt="infoset">information
						set</dfn> (infoset). The infoset is logically divided into two sets of properties: those that
					describe the publication and those that express key structures. These classifications only exist for the
					purposes of understanding the function of the properties, however.</p>

				<p>The infoset is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the sense that it represents a set of
					information that a user agent has to compile about the Web Publication, but it also becomes concrete when
					the user agent creates an internal representation of that information.</p>

				<p>The infoset is primarily compiled from a Web Publication's <a>manifest</a>, whose serialization
					requirements are defined in <a href="#manifest-serialization"></a>. Some information can be obtained in
					outside the manifest, however. For example, fallback rules for properties defined in the following
					subsections allow a user agent to compile information that the author has not provided in the manifest,
					whether as an intentional optimization or by accidental omission.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="infoset-req">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>

				<p>The requirements for the expression of infoset properties are as follows:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Descriptive Properties</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>REQUIRED: <a href="#wp-address">address</a></p>
						<div>
							<span>RECOMMENDED:</span>
							<ul class="flat">
								<li><a href="#wp-a11y">accessibility</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-dir">base direction</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-canonical-identifier">canonical identifier</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-creators">creator</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-language">language</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-mod-date">modification date</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-privacy">privacy policy</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-pub-date">publication date</a></li>
								<li><a href="#wp-title">title</a></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt>Structural Properties</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>REQUIRED: <a href="#wp-default-reading-order">default reading order</a> and <a
								href="#wp-resource-list">resource list</a></p>
						<p>RECOMMENDED: <a href="#wp-table-of-contents">table of contents</a></p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p class="ednote">These requirements reflect the current minimum consensus, though a number of issues remain
					open that could change whether an item is required or recommended. See the following sections for more
					information.</p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="21">Whether the minimum manifest must include any metadata, or a specific slot
					to handle metadata. (Note: this is now more specifically related to the infoset.)</p>
			</section>

			<section id="infoset-meta">
				<h3>Descriptive Properties</h3>

				<section id="wp-a11y">
					<h4>Accessibility</h4>

					<p>Accessibility metadata allows the discovery of features and affordances of the <a>Web Publication</a>
						that enable its use by users with different reading requirements and needs.</p>

					<p class="ednote">How to express accessibility metadata remains to be determined. This could be a
						grouping of properties from schema.org, for example, or could be split out into a list of individual
						properties.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-address">
					<h4>Address</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>address</dfn> is a <a>URL</a> that refers to the Web Publication. It dereferences to the <a
							href="#wp-entry-page">entry page</a>, which enables the retrieval of a representation of the
							<a>manifest</a>.</p>

					<p>The availability of this address does not preclude the creation and use of other identifiers and/or
						addresses to retrieve a representation of a <a>Web Publication</a> in whole or part.</p>

					<div class="note">The Web Publication's address can also be used as value for an identifier link relation
						[[link-relation]].</div>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-dir">
					<h4>Base Direction</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>base direction</dfn> identifies the display direction for <a>infoset</a> properties.</p>

					<p>The value of this property MUST be one of:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt><code>ltr</code></dt>
						<dd>left-to-right</dd>
						<dt><code>rtl</code></dt>
						<dd>right-to-left</dd>
						<dt><code>auto</code></dt>
						<dd>direction is determined from the value of the property</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>If not specified, the value <code>ltr</code> SHOULD be assumed.</p>

					<p>If property values are harvested from another resource, such as the <a>table of contents</a>,
						precedence SHOULD be given to the base direction specified in the resource, when provided.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-canonical-identifier">
					<h4>Canonical Identifier</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>canonical identifier</dfn> is a unique identifier that resolves to the preferred version of the
						Web Publication. The canonical identifier SHOULD be an <a>address</a>, but, if not, it MUST be
						possible to make a one-to-one mapping to an address (e.g., a DOI can be resolved to a URL via a DOI
						resolver).</p>

					<p>If a Web Publication is hosted at more than one address, this identifier allows a user agent to
						identify the shared relationship between the versions and to determine which of the available
						addresses is primary.</p>

					<p>The canonical identifier is also intended to provide a measure of permanence above and beyond the Web
						Publication's address. Even if a Web Publication is permanently relocated to a new address, for
						example, the canonical identifier will provide a way of locating the new location (e.g., a DOI
						registry could be updated with the new URL, or a redirect could be added to the URL of the canonical
						identifier).</p>

					<p>When assigned, the canonical identifier needs to be unique to one and only one Web Publication,
						independent of its address(es). Ensuring uniqueness is outside the scope of this specification,
						however. The actual uniqueness achievable depends on such factors as the conventions of the
						identifier scheme used and the degree of control over assignment of identifiers.</p>

					<p class="note">If the canonical identifier is a URL, it can be used as the target of a "canonical"
						link&#160;[[rfc6596]] (e.g., an [[html]] <code>link</code> element whose <code>rel</code> attribute
						has the value <code>canonical</code> or a Link HTTP header field [[rfc5988]] similarly
						identified).</p>

					<p class="issue" data-number="58">The question is whether a canonical identifier is necessary to call out
						explicitly in the infoset, or whether it is/can be handled by other metadata.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-creators">
					<h4>Creators</h4>

					<p>Creators are the individuals or entities responsible for the creation of the <a>Web
						Publication</a>.</p>

					<p>The role the creator played in the creation of the Web Publication SHOULD also be specified (e.g.,
						'author', 'illustrator', 'translator').</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-language">
					<h4>Language</h4>

					<p>The language specified in the <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<a>infoset</a> identifies the natural language of its properties.</p>

					<p>When specified, the language MUST be a tag that conforms to [[!bcp47]].</p>

					<p class="note">This language is not used in the processing or rendering of the Web Publication, and is
							<strong>not</strong> a replacement for identifying the language of each resource as defined by

					<h4>Default Reading Order</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>default reading order</dfn> is a specific progression through a set of <a>Web Publication</a>
						resources.</p>

					<p>A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such interaction
						the default reading order defines the expected progression from one resource to the next.</p>

					<p>The default reading order MUST include at least one resource.</p>

					<p>The default reading order is either specified directly in the manifest or in an [[!html]]
							<code>nav</code> element. In the latter case, the manifest MUST provide a link to the Web
						Publication resource that contains the <code>nav</code> element, with a fragment identifier that
						specifically identifies it.</p>

					<p>The process for extracting a default reading order from a <code>nav</code> element are as follows:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>extract a list of resource paths referenced from the <code>href</code> attribute of all
								<code>a</code> elements;</li>
						<li>strip any fragment identifiers from the references;</li>
						<li>resolve all relative paths to full URLs;</li>
						<li>remove all consecutive references to the same resource, leaving only the first.</li>

						are external to it.</p>

					<p>The completeness of the resource list will affect the usability of the Web Publication in certain
						reading scenarios (e.g., the ability to read the Web Publication offline). For this reason, it is
						strongly RECOMMENDED to always provide a comprehensive list of all of the Web Publication's constituent

					<p>In some cases, a comprehensive list of these resources might not be easily achieved (e.g., third-party

						consumable even if some of these resources are not identified as belonging to the Web Publication
						(e.g., when it is taken offline without them).</p>

					<p>If a user agent encounters a resource that it cannot locate in the resource list, it MUST treat the

			<h2>Web Publication Lifecycle</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>The publishing working group is currently evaluating the best approach for implementing Web Publications
					in user agents. This note is intended to provide an overview of where current thinking is and what issues
					are under consideration.</p>

				<p>The development of web publications is not viewed as a separate forking of the web, but an enhancement
					layer that can be supported by user agents. To that end, the primary constraints on any solution for web
					publications are that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the rendering of web publications must not interfere with the underlying web model and APIs. All
						functionality and enhancements must be layered on top.</li>
					<li>a web publication should not have to carry its own implementation code. Functionality is ideally
						provided by the user agent and/or polyfill.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While this specification will provide implementation flexibility for user agents, there are still a number
					of areas that have been identified as potentially needing to be detailed. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>initialization expectations for a web publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>use agent initiation v. user prompts;</li>
							<li>linked v. directly loaded manifests;</li>
							<li>resources that belong to more than one web publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>the creation of a "publication state":</p>
						<ul>
							<li>persistence of publication information across page loads</li>
							<li>location and persistence of UI;</li>
							<li>indications of supported features;</li>
							<li>DOM issues such as persistence of numbering schemes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>tracking the extent of a publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>taking an entire publication offline;</li>
							<li>enabling search across documents.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>establishing the bounds of a publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>when to end the publication state;</li>
							<li>document history traversal;</li>
							<li>how to handle links outside the publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>updating of the manifest.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The working group intends to flesh out the lifecycle in later revisions once it is clearer what models are
					viable and what solutions can be standardized. Input on the feasibility and challenges of these
					approaches is welcome at any time.</p>

			<h2>Reading Enhancements</h2>

			<section id="layout">
				<h3>Layout</h3>

				<p>The layout and rendering of <a>Web Publications</a> is governed by the same rules that apply to all Web
					content: [[!html]] documents are styled and laid out according to the rules of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a>, [[!svg]] files are rendered as expected of that format,
					and so on. This specification requires no particular profile or subset of CSS, HTML, or SVG to be
					supported, other than the expectations set for these technologies by their respective specifications.</p>


				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification intentionally refrains from introducing any new layout features. Any shortcoming of
						the Web platform in terms of layout needs to be addressed for the whole Web platform, which means via
						CSS.</p>

					<p>This working group will work with other relevant groups of the W3C to address platform-wide
						limitations that negatively impact <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<p>For the purposes of layout, each resource of a Web Publication is treated as a separate document. User
					agents MUST NOT mix content from multiple resources in the same rendering (e.g., <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS floats</a> or <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#absolutely-positioned">absolutely positioned
						elements</a> from one resource cannot intrude or overlap with content from an other resource).</p>

				<div class="issue">
					<p>Despite this general requirement that each resource should be treated as a separate document for the
						purpose of layout, there are some places where CSS specifications should be amended to be able to
						deal more intelligently with collections of resources like Web Publications.</p>

					<p>One instance is the definition of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-content/#cross-references"
							>cross references</a>, which are currently restricted to work only within a single document. This
						restriction should be relaxed to allow for cross references between separate resources of a single
						Web Publication.</p>

					<p>Another related one would be to allow <a
							href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#counter-properties">counters</a> to accumulate across
						multiple resources of a single <a>Web Publication</a> (e.g., so that figures in multiple sections may
						be numbered in a single sequence).</p>

				</div>

				<section id="scrolling-or-paginating" class="informative">
					<h4>Scrolling or Paginating</h4>

					<p>Publications have historically been presented via paged media, whereas Web pages almost always scroll.
						As the preferences of individual readers vary, and as different types of publications are better
						suited for one or the other, this specification encourages user agents to support both, and to offer
						a choice to their users.</p>

					<div class="issue">
						<p>It may be useful for authors to be able to specify a preference between scrolling and pagination,
							even if a strict requirement is not possible. This should most likely be addressed through an
							extension of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt-1/#atviewport-rule"
									><code>@viewport</code></a> or of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta">the viewport meta tag</a>(see
							[[css-device-adapt]]), or possibly through an extension of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#at-page-rule"><code>@page</code></a> (See
							[[css-page-3]]). This should be discussed with the relevant working groups (<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSSWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/"

				<section id="enh-pagination">
					<h4>Paginated Layout</h4>

					<p>When a User Agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a> in a paginated layout, it MUST lay out each
						document in the <a>default reading order</a> sequentially, with the last page of a resource being
						followed by the first page of the subsequent one.</p>

					<div class="issue">
						<p>To avoid blank pages, if a resource ends on a left page (resp. right page), the subsequent one
							should start on a right page (resp. left page) even if the <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> (see
							[[!css-page-3]]) would otherwise lead to it starting on the opposite page. It should also be
							possible to use the <a href="">break-before</a> property (See [[!css-break-3]]) to force the
							content to resume on the opposite side if that was desired by the author.</p>

						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended to describe this exception to the general behavior when dealing
							with collections of documents instead of individual documents.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="issue">
						<p>How is pagination supposed to work when subsequent resources have opposite <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> directions (see

							a problem from a layout point of view, as each page is independent, but from an UI point of view.
							If swiping left means next page until the end of one chapter, and starts meaning previous page in
							the next chapter because the language is switched from English to Hebrew, this is going to be
							confusing.</p>

					<h4>Reading Order</h4>

					<p>Hyperlinks are the means by which multiple resources are linked together on the Web. When users reach

						the links. It is also limited to media types that support hyperlinks.</p>

					<p>The <a>default reading order</a> provides an enhancement to the hyperlink model, allowing the user
						agent to automatically move the user to the next resource when a more natural action occurs, like a

			<h3>Web Publication Locators</h3>

			<p>Locators are used to identify, locate, retrieve, and/or reference locations and content fragments within
					<a>Web Publications</a> (e.g., for address(es), bookmarks, and annotations). Locators traditionally take
				the form of fragment identifiers [[rfc3986]], where the portion of a URL preceded by a number sign character
					(<code>#</code>) identifies a specific position within the referenced resource.</p>

			<p>For some use cases, it is essential to identify and reference a <a>Web Publication</a> resource—or a location
				in or a segment of a resource—in the scope or context of the Web Publication to which it belongs. A
				traditional fragment identifier cannot satisfy this requirement, since only the URL of the constituent
				resource containing the location or content fragment of interest is expressed. Web Publication Locators
				[[pub-loc]] address this issue by providing the means to express both the URL of the resource and the URL of
				the Web Publication.</p>

			<p>Web Publication Locators also address the problem of referencing into a resource that was not authored with
				such a need in mind. A fragment identifier can only reference elements with explicit identifiers and
				locations with explicit anchor points. Web Publication locators include a variety of selectors that work
				with the general structures and content of a resource (e.g., text selectors, CSS selectors).</p>

			<p class="ednote">As Web Publication Locators currently rely on a JSON-based expression syntax, it is not yet
				clear how much of this syntax can be translated to a fragment identifier. This may limit the usefulness

				<p>Illustrate with example of an easy to understand Web Publication Locator, such as might be used in
					annotating a simple Web Publication.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The semantics of Web Publication Locators are a mapping and extension of the Web Annotation Data Model
				[[annotation-model]] and Vocabulary [[annotation-vocab]] for describing and referencing a segment of a Web
				resource. As a result, Web Publication Locators provide the expressiveness needed for a broad range of
				annotation and bookmarking use cases. Additionally, Web Publication Locators provide a way to identify and
				reference a location within a Web Publication (i.e., as distinct from identifying and referencing a content
				fragment consisting of a span of characters or bytes). A Web Publication Locator can be used to identify,
				retrieve and/or reference a fragment of a Web Publication that spans multiple resources. </p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In composing a Web Publication Locator, use the canonical identifier of the Web Publication in preference
					to any alternative addresses. Such use facilitates the collation of Web Publication Locators associated
					with a particular Web Publication. URLs of Web Publication resources appearing in a Web Publication
					Locator should match the URL of the resource provided in the <a>infoset</a>.</p>
