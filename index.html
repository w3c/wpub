			<p>This first public working draft provides a preliminary outline of a Web Publication. Many details are under

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="background" class="informative">
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>For millenia now, the written word has been the primary means of encoding and sharing ideas and
					information. The publication as a bounded edition, made public, has been used to carry intellectual and
					artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals, magazines, newspapers, articles,
					laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos, manuals, and albums of all
					sorts.</p>

				<p>More recently, with the advent of the information age, print has been ceding ground to digital, and the
					Web has become a major forum for the public dissemination of ideas. But the Web is unbounded: information
					and resources are only loosely connected through hyperlinks. While this model has helped the Web thrive
					in many areas, it has proven problematic for traditional information publishing—users often cannot access
					works in their entirety, especially when offline, and have not been able to easily access, compile and
					download content for curation and personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of
					non-Web document formats to redress these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready
					content and alternative offline renditions to ensure publications are fully available.</p>

				<p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
					of both models—the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
					accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
					that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
					work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>
			</section>

			<!-- <section id="nature">
				<h3>Web Publications</h3>

				<p>The act of publishing involves obtaining resources, organizing them into a publication and making that
					publication available on a Web server. In doing so, the publisher establishes the interconnectedness that
					binds the resources into a single work. This process also provides an origin for the Web Publication and
					a URL that uniquely identifies it, giving provenance to the work.</p>

				<p>The establishment of this discoverable and identifiable collection is what enables users to access their
					content without concern for whether they are online or offline. The user agent can cache the resources
					ensuring that the Web Publication is available and functional while offline, providing the user, as much
					as possible, a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network
					connection.</p>

				<p>The Web Publication introduces the concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the
					constituent resources of the publication. The manifest includes metadata that describes the publication
					as a whole, as it has an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources. The metadata and manifest
					also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication also provides a default ordering of its primary constituent resources, although that
					order may be changed by user interaction or scripting. The user is able to access any primary resource
					directly via navigation provided by the publication itself or via the user agent.</p>
			</section> -->

			<section id="terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>Wherever appropriate, this document relies on terminology defined by the note on "Publishing and Linking
					on the Web" [[!publishing-linking]]. In particular, for the following terms: <a class="externalDFN"
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user">user</a>, <a class="externalDFN"
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a>, <a
						class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-browser">browser</a>, and <a
						class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-address">address</a>.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><dfn>Default Reading Order</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The default reading order is a specific progression through one or more <a>primary resources</a>
							defined in the <a>manifest</a> by the author of a <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>
						<p>A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such
							interaction the default reading order defines the expected progression from one primary resource
							to the next.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Identifier</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>An identifier is metadata that can be used to refer to a <a class="externalDFN"
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-web-content">Web Content</a> in a
							persistent and unambiguous manner. URLs, URNs, DOIs, ISBNs, or PURLs are all examples of
							persistent identifiers frequently used in publishing.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Manifests">Manifest</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A manifest represents structured information about a <a>Web Publication</a>, such as informative
							metadata, a list of all <a data-lt="primary resource">primary</a> and <a>secondary resources</a>,
							and a <a>default reading order</a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Primary Resources">Primary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A primary resource is one that is presented directly by a user agent (i.e., not embedded within
							another).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Secondary Resources">Secondary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A secondary resource is one that is required for the processing or rendering of a <a>primary
								resource</a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn>URL</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In this specification, the general term URL is used as in other W3C specifications like
							HTML&#160;[[!html]], and is defined by URL Standard of the WhatWG&#160;[[!url]]. In particular,
							such a URL allows for the usage of characters from Unicode following&#160;[[!rfc3987]]. See <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/references.html#biblio-url">the note in the HTML5
								document</a> for further details.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publications|Web Publication's">Web Publication</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A Web Publication is a collection of one or more <a>primary resources</a>, organized together
							through a <a>manifest</a> into a single logical work with a <a>default reading order</a>. The Web
							Publication is uniquely identifiable and presentable using Open Web Platform technologies.</p>

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication is conformant to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST have a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to all normative requirements defined in <a
							href="#manifest-conformance">Manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p id="ua-conformance">A user agent is conformant to this specification if it meets the following
					criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST be capable of generating a conforming <a href="#wp-infoset">infoset</a> for a Web
						Publication.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="infoset">
			<h2>Information Set</h2>

			<p class="ednote">The name "infoset" may change depending on feedback. Although this term has a different meaning
				for individuals familiar with XML, alternatives such as "properties" and "metadata" do not fully capture the
				nature or purpose.</p>

			<section id="infoset-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>A Web Publication is defined by a set of properties and features known as its information set (infoset).
					The infoset is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the sense that it represents a set of
					information that a user agent has to be able to compile about the Web Publication, but it also becomes
					concrete when the user agent creates an internal representation of the information.</p>

				<p>The infoset does not require a specific serialization. It is primarily compiled from a Web Publication's
						<a>manifest</a>, whose serialization requirements are defined in <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>. It
					is therefore possible to express the same infoset via different manifests, although a Web Publication
					will only have one manifest.</p>

				<p>Although the manifest is the primary source of the infoset, some information may be obtained independent
					of it. For example, fallback rules for properties defined in the following subsections allow a user agent
					to compile information that the author has not provided in the manifest, whether as an intentional
					optimization or by accidental omission.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="infoset-req">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>

				<p>The Web Publication infoset MUST include the following information:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="#title">title</a> (or "name") of the Web Publication.</li>
					<li>The <a href="#language">default (natural) language</a> of the Web Publication.</li>
					<li>The <a href="#address">address</a> of the Web Publication.</li>
					<li>The <a href="#resources">Web Publication resources</a>.</li>
					<li>The <a href="#default-reading-order">default reading order</a> of the Web Publication.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, the infoset SHOULD include the following information:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A <a href="#canonical-identifier">canonical identifier</a>.</li>
					<li>The <a href="#table-of-contents">table of contents</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="ednote">These requirements reflect the current minimum consensus, though a number of issues remain
					open that could change whether an item is required or recommended. See the following sections for more
					information.</p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="15">Ignoring issues such as location, serialization, etc. What is the minimum
					viable manifest? (Note: this is now specifically related to the infoset.)</p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="21">Whether the minimum manifest must include any metadata, or a specific slot
					to handle metadata. (Note: this is now more specifically related to the infoset.)</p>

				<!-- <p class = "issue" data-number="30">Should Title be Required for the Publication for WCAG 2 Compliance?</p> -->
			</section>

			<section id="title">
				<h3>Title</h3>

				<p>The Web Publication's infoset requires a title.</p>

				<p>If a title is not specified in the <a href="#manifest">manifest</a>, the user agent MUST provide one as
					follows:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>If the Web Publication contains at least one primary resource whose media type includes a
							<code>title</code> element (e.g., SVG or HTML), use the title of the first instance listed in the
						default reading order.</li>
					<li>If the preceding step results in an empty title, or no primary resources are recognized as having a
						title, the user agent MUST use its own algorithm to produce a title (e.g., inspect subsequent primary
						resources or provide a placeholder title).</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A user agent may not be able to produce a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-title">meaningful title</a> [[WCAG20]]
						for a Web Publication based on the above rules. Authors are encouraged to ensure that their manifest
						contains such a title, or one is provided in one of the two steps above.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="issue" data-number="20">
					<p>(See also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/24">issue #24</a>.) The question is whether the
						manifest MUST include a title or not.</p>

					<p>In the current proposal, a title is required in the infoset because the user agent must create one
						using the fallback mechanism when not present in the manifest.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="language">
				<h3>Language</h3>

				<p>The Web Publication's infoset requires the language(s) of its content be specified. The language MUST be a
					tag that conforms to [[!BCP47]] or its successors.</p>

				<p>If the language is not specified in the <a href="#manifest">manifest</a>, the user agent MUST provide one
					as follows:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>If the Web Publication contains at least one primary resource whose media type allows the language to
						be specified (e.g., SVG or HTML), use the language of the first instance listed in the default
						reading order.</li>
					<li>If the preceding step results in an empty language tag, use the value "<code>und</code>"
						(undetermined).</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="issue" data-number="29">
					<p>The question is whether the manifest MUST include the language(s) of the content or not.</p>

				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="canonical-identifier">
				<h3>Canonical Identifier</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a> canonical identifier is an <a>identifier</a> assigned to it by the publisher.
					It SHOULD be an <a href="#pub-address">address</a>, but, if not, it MUST be possible to make a 1-to-1
					mapping to an address.</p>

				<p>If the canonical identifier is a URL, it MAY be used as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute of a
					"canonical" <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!rfc6596]] (i.e., a <code>link</code> element with the
					attribute <code>rel="canonical"</code> specified on it).</p>

				<p>If assigned, this canonical identifier MUST be unique to the <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="address">
				<h3>Address</h3>

				<p>A Web Publication's address is a <a>URL</a> that refers to a <a>Web Publication</a> and enables the
					retrieval of a representation of the <a>manifest</a> of the Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The availability of this address does not preclude the creation and use of other identifiers and/or
					addresses to retrieve a representation of a <a>Web Publication</a> in whole or part.</p>

				<div class="note">The Web Publication's <a href="#pub-address">address</a> can also be used as value for an
					identifier link relation [[link-relation]].</div>
			</section>

			<section id="resources">
				<h3>Resources</h3>

				<p>The infoset MUST include a list of the <a>primary resources</a> of the Web Publication, regardless of
					whether a primary resource is also used as a <a>secondary resource</a> in another context (e.g., an image
					might be embedded in an HTML document and also be rendered directly in a user agent via a link to view
					the raw image).</p>

				<p>The infoset also SHOULD list secondary resources, although the list is not required to be exhaustive.</p>

				<p class="issue" data-number="22">The discussion led to the question whether the manifest/infoset MUST list
					all <a>Secondary resources</a> or not. In this sense, this became a duplicate of <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/23">issue #23</a> ended up at the same question.</p>
