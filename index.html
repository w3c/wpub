			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="what-is-wp" class="informative">
				<h3>What is a Web Publication</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information
					about the Web Publication is expressed in a machine-readable document called a <a>manifest</a>,
					which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection
					between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describe the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity
					and nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources
					that belong to the Web Publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources
					into a single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable in one of two ways: resources either include a link to the manifest
					(via an HTTP Link header or an HTML <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!html]]), or the manifest can
					be loaded directly by a compatible user agent.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored
					specifically for their unique reading needs.</p>

			<section id="scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the
					way that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type
					of work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

				<p>The specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the
					consumption of Web Publications. While a primary goal is that traditional Web user agents (browsers)
					will be able to consume Web Publications, this should not limit the capabilities of any other
					possible type of user agent (e.g., applications, whether standalone or running within a user agent,
					or even Web Publications that include their own user interface). As a result, the specification does
					not attempt to architect required solutions for situations whose expected outcome will vary
					depending on the nature of the user agent and the expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to
					initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how much of a Web Publication to cache for offline
					use).</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined by the W3C Note "Publishing and Linking on the

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication conforms to this specification if it meets the following

			<h2>Web Publication Construction</h2>

			<section id="wp-infoset-manifest" class="informative">
				<h3>Infoset and Manifest</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is defined by a set of items known as its <dfn data-lt="infoset">information
						set</dfn> (<abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr>). The <abbr title="information set"
						>infoset</abbr> is both abstract and concrete. It is abstract in the sense that it represents a
					set of information that a user agent has to compile about the Web Publication, but it also becomes
					concrete when the user agent creates an internal representation of that information.</p>

				<p>A <a>manifest</a>, on the other hand, is a serialization of an <abbr title="information set"
							><a>infoset</a></abbr> created by the author of a <a>Web Publication</a>. The manifest is
					expressed using the JSON-LD&#160;[[!json-ld]] format &#8212; a variant of JSON&#160;[[ecma-404]] for
					expressing linked data. The manifest can be created as a standalone resource or it can be embedded
					within an HTML document.</p>

				<p>Although the <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> is primarily compiled from a Web
					Publication's <a>manifest</a>, some information is obtained outside the manifest. The table of
					contents, for example, may be referenced from the manifest but is serialized in an HTML
					document.</p>

				<p>This specification describes the requirements for creating both the infoset and manifest. This
					section, in particular, details how to create a manifest, and <a href="#wp-properties">the next</a>
					lists the various properties common to infosets and manifests.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-manifest">
				<h3>Creating a Manifest</h3>

				<section id="manifest-context">
					<h4>Manifest Contexts</h4>

					<p> A Web Publication Manifest MUST start by setting the JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]]. The context
						has the following two major components:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the [[!schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
						<li>the Web Publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context</code></li>
					</ul>

					<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

					<p>The Web Publication context file MAY add features to the properties defined in Schema.org (e.g.,
						the requirement for the <a href="https://schema.org/creator">creator</a> property to be order
						preserving).</p>


					<p class="ednote">As part of the continuous contacts with Schema.org the additional features defined
						in the Web Publication context file could migrate to the core Schema.org vocabulary.</p>

					<p class="note">Although Schema.org is often referenced using the <code>http</code> URI scheme, <a
							href="https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19">the vocabulary is being migrated</a> to use the
						secure <code>https</code> scheme as its default. This specification requires the use
							<code>https</code> when referencing Schema.org in the manifest.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="manifest-values">
					<h4>Values</h4>

					<section id="arrays-and-single-values">
						<h5>Arrays and Single Values</h5>

						<p>Various manifest properties can have one or more values. As a general rule, these values can
							be expressed as [[!json]]&#160; arrays. When the property value is an array with a single
							element, however, the array syntax can be omitted.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of an array">
							<p>As a Web Publication typically contains many resources, this declaration of a single
								resource:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "resources" : "datatypes.svg",
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>is equivalent to the array:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "resources" : ["datatypes.svg"],
    &#8230;
}</pre>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="strings-vs-objects">
						<h5>Text Values or Objects</h5>

						<p>Various manifest properties are expected to be expressed as [[!json]]&#160;objects. Although
							the use of objects is usually RECOMMENDED, it is also acceptable to use string values that
							are interpreted as objects depending on the context. The exact mapping of text values to
							objects is part of the property or object definitions.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of a Person object.">
							<p>The following author name is expressed as a text string:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "author" : "Herman Melville",
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>but, in the context of <a href="#creators">creators</a>, it is equivalent to:</p>

							<pre>
{
    "author" : {
        "@type" : "Person"
        "name"  : "Herman Melville"
    },
    &#8230;
}</pre>
							<p>(See <a href="#creators"></a> for further details.)</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="link-values">
						<h5>Link Values</h5>

						<p>With the exception of the <a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>, the
							Web Publication properties typically link to one or more resources. When a property requires
							a link value, the link MUST be expressed in one of the following two ways:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>as a string encoding the (absolute or relative) URL of the resources&#160;[[!url]];
								or</li>
							<li>as an instance of a <a href="#publication-link-def"><code>PublicationLink</code>
									object</a> that can be used to express the URL, the media type, and other
								characteristics of the target resource.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>In other words, a single string value is a shorthand for a <code>PublicationLink</code>
							object whose <code>url</code> property is set to that string value. (See also <a
								href="#strings-vs-objects"></a>.)</p>

						<pre class="example" title="Resource list that includes one link using a relative URL as a string ('datatypes.svg') and two that display the various properties of the a PublicationLink object">
{
    &#8230;
    "resources" : [
        "datatypes.svg",

					<h4>Publication Types</h4>

					<p> The Web Publication Manifest MUST include a <dfn>Publication Type</dfn> using the
							<code>@type</code> keyword&#160;[[!json-ld]]. The type MAY be mapped onto the <a
							href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><code>CreativeWork</code></a>
						type&#160;[[!schema.org]].</p>

					<pre class="example" title="Setting a Web Publication's type to CreativeWork.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "@type"    : "CreativeWork"
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

					<p>Schema.org also includes a number of more specific types, all subtypes of
							<code>CreativeWork</code>, such as <a href="https://schema.org/Article">Article</a>, <a
							href="https://schema.org/Book">Book</a>, and <a href="https://schema.org/Course">Course</a>.
						These MAY be used instead of <code>CreativeWork</code>. </p>

					<pre class="example" title="Setting a Web Publication's type to Book.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "@type"    : "Book"
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

					<p>Each schema.org type defines a set of properties that are valid for use with it. To ensure that
						the manifest can be validated and processed by schema.org aware processors, the manifest SHOULD
						contain only the properties associated with the selected type.</p>

					<p>If properties from more than one type are needed, the manifest MAY include multiple type
						declarations.</p>

					<pre class="example" title="A Web Publication that combines properties from both Book and VisualArtwork.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "@type"    : ["Book", "VisualArtwork"],

}
</pre>

					<p>User agents SHOULD NOT fail to process manifests that are not valid to their declared schema.org
						type(s).</p>

					<h4>Properties</h4>

					<p>The naming, syntax, and requirements for manifest properties are defined in <a
							href="#wp-properties"></a>.</p>

					<p class="note">Although authors only have to understand the serialization requirements for manifest
						terms, they are encouraged to read through the infoset definitions for each property, as well.
						The infoset definitions describe, in some cases, how items are compiled in the absence of
						explicit information in the manifest.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-relative-urls">
					<h4>Relative URLs</h4>

					<p>
						<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string">Relative URL strings</a> MAY be used
						in the manifest. These URLs are resolved into <a
							href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string">absolute URL strings</a> using a <a
							href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-base-url">base URL</a>&#160;[[!url]]. </p>

					<p>The base URL for relative URLs is determined as follows:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>In the case of an <a href="#manifest-embedding">embedded manifest</a>, it is the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#document-base-url">document base
								URL</a>&#160;[[!html]] of the <a>primary entry page</a> of the Web Publication;</li>
						<li>In the case of a <a href="#wp-linking">linked manifest</a>, it is URL of the manifest
							resource.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>For embedded manifests, this means that relative URLs are resolved against the URL of the primary
						entry page <em>unless</em> the page declares a base direction (i.e., in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/document-metadata.html#the-base-element"
								><code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element</a> in its header or via an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-xmlbase-attribute-xml-only"

				<p>When embedding a manifest, the <code>type</code> attribute of the containing <code>script</code>

			<h2>Web Publication Properties</h2>

			<section id="properties-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Both the Web Publication infoset and manifest are defined by a common set of properties that describe
					the basic information a user agent requires to process and render a Web Publication. These
					properties are categorized as followed:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Descriptive properties describe aspects of a Web Publication, such as its <a href="#wptitle"
								>title</a>, <a href="#creators">creator</a>, and <a href="#language-and-dir"
								>language</a>. These properties are primarily drawn from <a href="https://schema.org"
								>Schema.org</a> and its <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">hosted
								extensions</a>&#160;[[schema.org]], so they map to one or several Schema.org properties
							and inherit their syntax and semantics. (The following property categories typically do not
							have Schema.org equivalents, so are defined specifically for Web Publications.)</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#resource-categorization-properties">resource categorization</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Resource categorization properties describe or identify common sets of resources, such as the
								<a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order">default
								reading order</a>. These properties refer to one or more external resources (images,
							script files, separate metadata files, etc.).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#informative-properties">informative properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Informative properties identify resources that contain additional information about the Web
							Publication, such as its <a href="#privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> or an <a
								href="#accessibility-report">accessibility report</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#structural-properties">structural properties</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Structural properties identify key meta structures of the Web Publication, such as the <a
								href="#cover">cover image</a> or the the location of the <a href="#table-of-contents"
								>table of contents</a>.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>


				<p class="note">The categorization of properties is done to simplify comprehension of their purpose; the
					groupings have no relevance outside this specification (i.e., the groupings do not exist in the
					infoset or manifest).</p>


				<div class="note">
					<p>Each manifest item drawn from schema.org identifies the property it maps to and includes its
						defining type in parentheses. Properties are often available in many types, however, as a result
						of the schema.org inheritance model. Refer to each property definition for more detailed
						information about where it is valid to use.</p>

					<p>Schema.org additionally includes a large number of properties that, though relevant for
						publishing, are not mentioned in this specification &#8212; Web Publication authors can use any
						of these properties. This document defines only the minimal set of infoset items.</p>
				</div>

				<p class="ednote">There are discussion on whether a best practices document would be created, referring
					to more schema.org terms. If so, it should be linked from here. </p>

					<h4>Canonical Identifier</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<dfn>canonical identifier</dfn> is a unique identifier that resolves to the preferred version of
						the Web Publication.</p>

					<p class="note">Ensuring uniqueness of canonical identifiers is outside the scope of this

						the identifier scheme used and the degree of control over assignment of identifiers.</p>

					<p>The canonical identifier is intended to provide a measure of permanence above and beyond the Web
						Publication's <a href="#address">address(es)</a>. If a Web Publication is permanently relocated
						to a new URL, for example, the canonical identifier provides a way of discovering the new
						location (e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> registry could be updated
						with the new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or a redirect could be added to
						the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the canonical identifier). It is also
						intended to provide a means of identifying instances of the same Web Publication hosted at
						different URLs.</p>

					<section id="canonical-identifier-infoset">
						<h5>Infoset Requirements</h5>

						<p>The canonical identifier MUST be a URL&#160;[[!url]].</p>

						<p>If a URL is not provided in the manifest, or the value is an invalid URL, the Web Publication
							does not have a canonical identifier. User agents MUST NOT attempt to construct a canonical
							identifier from any other identifiers provided in the manifest.</p>

						<p class="note">The canonical identifier can be used as the target of a "canonical"

					<h4>Language and Base Direction</h4>

					<p>The <a>Web Publication</a> has a natural language value (e.g., English, French, Chinese), as well
						as a natural base writing direction (left-to-right or right-to-left). The <abbr
							title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> has entries to set these values, which can
						influence, for example, the behavior of a user agent (e.g., it might place a pop-up for a table
						of contents on the right hand side for publications whose natural base direction is
						right-to-left).</p>

					<p>Similarly, each natural language property value in the <a>Web Publication's</a>
						<abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> (e.g., <a href="#wptitle">title</a>, <a
							href="#creators">creators</a>) is <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/string-meta/#dom-localizable"
						>localizable</a>&#160;[[string-meta]], meaning that the same information is available for
						each.</p>

					<p>As a result, the <abbr title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr> has entries to set:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the natural <dfn>language</dfn>, and </li>
						<li>the <dfn>base direction</dfn> (the display direction for the value)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>of both the <a>Web Publication</a> and the natural language properties values of the <abbr
							title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>


					<section id="language-and-dir-infoset">
						<h5>Infoset Requirements</h5>

						<p>The <abbr title="information set">infoset</abbr> MAY contain global language and base
							direction declarations for the Web Publication. The natural language MUST be a tag that
							conforms to&#160;[[!bcp47]], while the base language direction MUST have one of the
							following values: </p>

						<ul>
							<li><code>ltr</code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally set to
								left-to-right text;</li>
							<li><code>rtl</code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally set to
								right-to-left text;</li>
							<li><code>auto</code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally set to
								the direction of the first character with a strong directionality.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>When specified, these properties are also used as defaults for textual values in the <abbr
								title="information set">infoset</abbr>.</p>

						<p class="note">It is important to differentiate the language <em>of the publication</em> from
							the language and the base direction of the individual resources that compose it. If such
							resources are, for example, in HTML, the language and direction need to be set in those
							resources, too. The language and base direction of the publication are not inherited.</p>

						<p>The global language information MAY be overridden by individual values.</p>

						<p>When using Web Publication manifests with bidirectional text, user agents SHOULD identify the
							base direction of any given natural language value by scanning the text for the first strong
							directional character. Once the base direction has been identified, user agents MUST
							determine the appropriate rendering and display of natural language values according to the
							Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm&#160;[[!bidi]]. This could require wrapping additional
							control characters or markup around the string prior to display, in order to apply the base
							direction. (See <a href="#bidi-examples"></a>.) </p>

						<p class="issue"> This section, in particular the features related to text directions, must be
							reviewed by I18N experts. </p>

						<p>If the manifest is <a href="#manifest-embedding">embedded</a> in the primary entry page via a
								<code>script</code> element, and the manifest does not set the global language and/or
							the base direction (see <a href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir"></a>), the
								<code>lang</code> and the <code>dir</code> attributes of the <code>script</code> element
							are used as the global <a>language</a> and <a>base direction</a>, respectively (see the
							details on handling the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-lang-and-xmllang-attributes"
									><code>lang</code></a> and <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-dir-attribute"><code>dir</code></a>
							attributes in&#160;[[!html]]).</p>

						<p class="issue">It is to be discussed whether this last paragraph, i.e., inheriting values from
								<code>script</code>, should be kept.</p>

						<p>If a user agent requires the language and one is not available in the <abbr
								title="information set">infoset</abbr> (globally, or specifically for that property), or
							the obtained value is invalid, the user agent MAY attempt to determine the language. This
							specification does not mandate how such a language tag is created. The user agent might:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>use the <a>non-empty</a> language declaration of the manifest;</li>
							<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default
									reading order</a>;</li>
							<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p> No default values are specified for the <a>language</a> or the default <a>base
							direction</a>. </p>

							<p> It is possible to set the language for any textual value in the manifest. This

}
</pre>
							<p> The value of the language tag MUST be set to a language code as defined in [[!bcp47]]. </p>

							<p>When used in a context of localizable texts, a simple string value is a shorthand for the
								object with the <code>@value</code> set to the string value, and the language set to the
								value of the <a href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir"><code>inLanguage</code></a>
								property, if applicable, and unset otherwise. In other words, the previous example is
								equivalent to:</p>

							<pre class="example" title="Setting the default language of an author name to French">
{
    "@context"   : ["https://schema.org","https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],

}

							<p>(See also <a href="#strings-vs-objects"></a>.)</p>

							<p>It is <em>not</em> possible to set the direction explicitly for a value.</p>

							<p class="note"> Setting the direction for a natural text value is currently not possible in
								JSON-LD&#160;[[!json-ld]]. In case the JSON-LD community, as well as the schema.org
								community, introduces such a feature, future versions of this specification may extend
								the ability of Web Publication Manifests to include this. </p>

					<p>The <dfn>links</dfn> property provides a list of <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> that are
							<em>not</em> required for the processing and rendering of a Web Publication (i.e., the
						content of the Web Publication remains unaffected even if these resources are not available).
						Linked resources are typically made available to user agents to augment or enhance the
						processing or rendering of it, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>a privacy policy or license that the user agent can offer a link to from a shelf;</li>
						<li>a metadata record that the user agent can use to discover and display more information about
							the Web Publication;</li>
						<li>a dictionary of terms the user agent can process to provide enhanced language help;</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The <code>links</code> property can also be used to identify resources that are used in the
						online rendering of a Web Publication, but that are not essential to include with it when it is
						taken offline or packaged (e.g., to minimize the size). These include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>large font files that enhance the appearance of the Web Publication but are not vital to its
							display (i.e., a fallback font will suffice);</li>
						<li>third-party scripts that are not intended for use when a Web Publication is taken offline or
							packaged (e.g., tracking scripts).</li>

						<h5>Infoset Requirements</h5>

						<p>User agents MUST compute the <code>table-of-contents</code> as follows:</p>

			<h4>Canonical Manifest</h4>

			<p>A <dfn data-lt="canonical manifest|canonical web publication manifest">Canonical Web Publication Manifest</dfn> (or Canonical Manifest) is a version of the Web Publication <a>Manifest</a> where all possible ambiguities on property values (see, e.g., <a href="#arrays-and-single-values"></a> or <a href="#strings-vs-objects"></a>) have been removed, and all values that are possibly harnessed from the <a>primary entry page</a> are incorporated. The steps to convert a Web Publication Manifest into a Canonical Manifest are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm takes the following arguments:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>the <code>manifest</code> string, that represent the <a>manifest</a> in JSON</li>
				<li>the <code>document</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#elementdef-document">HTML Document (DOM) Node</a>&nbsp;[[!html]], representing the <a>primary entry page</a></li>
				<li>the <code>base</code> URL string, that represents the base URL for the manifest, and has the value of:
					<ul>
						<li>the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-node-baseuri">baseURI</a>&nbsp;[[!dom]] value of the <code>script element</code> in the <a>primary entry page</a>, in case the manifest is <a href="#manifest-embedding">embedded</a>; or</li>
						<li>the URL of the manifest otherwise</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>the <code>lang</code> string represents the default language, and has the value oft:

						<li><code>undefined</code> otherwise</li>
					</ul>
					<li>the <code>dir</code> string represents the base direction, and has the value oft:
						<ul>
							<li>is the value of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-dir-attribute"><code>dir</code> value</a>&nbsp;[[!html]] for the <code>script</code> element in the <a>primary entry page</a>, in case the manifest is <a href="#manifest-embedding">embedded</a>; or </li>

			<h2>Web Publication Lifecycle</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>The publishing working group is currently evaluating the best approach for implementing <a>Web
						Publications</a> in user agents. This note is intended to provide an overview of where current
					thinking is at and what issues are under consideration.</p>

				<p>The development of Web Publications is not viewed as a separate forking of the Web, but an
					enhancement layer that can be supported by user agents. To that end, the primary constraints on any
					solution for Web Publications are that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the rendering of Web Publications must not interfere with the underlying Web model and <abbr
							title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> &#8212; all functionality and
						enhancements must be layered on top;</li>
					<li>a Web Publication should not have to carry its own implementation code &#8212; functionality is
						ideally provided by the user agent and/or polyfill.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While this specification will provide implementation flexibility for user agents, there are still a
					number of areas that have been identified as potentially needing to be detailed. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>initialization expectations for a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>automatic initiation v. user prompts;</li>
							<li>linked v. directly loaded manifests;</li>
							<li>resources that belong to more than one Web Publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>the creation of a "publication state":</p>
						<ul>
							<li>persistence of publication information across page loads;</li>
							<li>location and persistence of UI;</li>
							<li>indications of supported features;</li>
							<li>DOM issues such as persistence of numbering schemes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>tracking the extent of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>taking an entire publication offline;</li>
							<li>enabling search across documents.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>establishing the bounds of a Web Publication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>when to end the publication state;</li>
							<li>document history traversal;</li>
							<li>how to handle links outside the publication.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>updating of the <a>manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The working group intends to flesh out the lifecycle in later revisions once it is clearer what
					models are viable and what solutions can be standardized. Input on the feasibility and challenges of
					these approaches is welcome at any time.</p>

				<h3>Switch to publication mode</h3>

						<a>publication mode</a>.</p>

				<p>This feature has the following requirements:</p>

				<ol>

				<h3>Presentation</h3>

				<section id="layout">
					<h4>Layout</h4>

					<p>The layout and rendering of <a>Web Publications</a> is governed by the same rules that apply to
						all Web content: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents are styled and
						laid out according to the rules of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, SVG
						documents are rendered as defined by that format, etc. This specification requires no particular
						profile or subset of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr
							title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics"
							>SVG</abbr> to be supported, other than the expectations set for these technologies by their
						respective specifications.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This specification intentionally avoids introducing any new layout features. Any shortcoming
							of the Web platform in terms of layout needs to be addressed for the whole Web platform,
							which means via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

						<p>This working group will work with other relevant groups of the <abbr
								title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to address platform-wide limitations that
							negatively impact <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>For the purposes of layout, each resource of a Web Publication is treated as a separate document.
						User agents MUST NOT mix content from multiple resources in the same rendering (e.g., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS floats</a> or <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#absolutely-positioned">absolutely positioned
							elements</a> from one resource cannot intrude or overlap with content from an other
						resource).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Despite this general requirement that each resource should be treated as a separate document
							for the purpose of layout, there are some places where <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"
								>CSS</abbr> specifications should be amended to be able to deal more intelligently with
							collections of resources like <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>

						<p>One instance is the definition of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-content/#cross-references">cross-references</a>,
							which are currently restricted to work only within a single document. This restriction
							should be relaxed to allow for cross-references between separate resources of a single Web
							Publication.</p>

						<p>Another related would be to allow <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#counter-properties">counters</a> to
							accumulate across multiple resources of a single Web Publication (e.g., so that figures in
							multiple sections may be numbered in a single sequence).</p>
					</div>

				</section>

				<section id="feature-user-settings">
					<h4>User Settings</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a>, it SHOULD provide user settings to customize
						the experience.</p>

					<p>User settings MAY include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>text size;</li>
						<li>font family;</li>
						<li>display mode (night, high contrast, etc.);</li>
						<li>playback speed (for audio and video resources).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This specification does not cover how user agents override author styles to offer user
						settings.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To provide user settings in their reader mode, browsers usually get rid of most of the author
							styles. There is always a tension in reading environments between author styles and the
							user's preference, which is very hard to balance.</p>
					</div>

					<p class="issue" data-number="138"></p>
				</section>

				<section id="scrolling-or-paginating" class="informative">
					<h4>Scrolling or Paginating</h4>

					<p>Publications have historically been presented via paged media, whereas Web pages almost always
						scroll. As the preferences of individual readers vary, and as different types of publications
						are better suited for one or the other, this specification encourages user agents to support
						both, and to offer a choice to their users.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>It might be useful for authors to be able to specify a preference between scrolling and
							pagination, even if a strict requirement is not possible. This should most likely be
							addressed through an extension of <a

								><code>@viewport</code></a> or of <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta">the viewport meta

								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#at-page-rule"><code>@page</code></a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). This should be discussed with the relevant working groups (<a

				</section>

				<section id="feature-pagination">
					<h4>Paginated Layout</h4>

					<p>When a user agent renders a <a>Web Publication</a> in a paginated layout, it MUST lay out each
						document in the <a>default reading order</a> sequentially, with the last page of a resource
						being followed by the first page of the subsequent one.</p>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>To avoid blank pages, if a resource ends on a left page (resp. right page), the subsequent
							one should start on a right page (resp. left page) even if the <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a>
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]) would otherwise lead to it starting on the opposite page. It
							should also be possible to use the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before">break-before</a> property
							(see&#160;[[!css-break-3]]) to force the content to resume on the opposite side if that was
							desired by the author.</p>

						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended to describe this exception to the general behavior when
							dealing with collections of documents instead of individual documents.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="ednote">
						<p>How is pagination supposed to work when subsequent resources have opposite <a
								href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#progression">page progression</a> directions
							(see&#160;[[css-page-3]]). For example, due to different a different writing mode? This is
							not necessarily a problem from a layout point of view, as each page is independent, but from
							an UI point of view. If swiping left means next page until the end of one chapter, and
							starts meaning previous page in the next chapter because the language is switched from
							English to Hebrew, this is going to be confusing.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>[[css-page-3]] needs to be amended so that <a

				<h3>Navigation</h3>

					<h4>Reading Order</h4>

					<p>Hyperlinks are the means by which multiple resources are linked together on the Web. When users
						reach the end of one resource, they have to activate a hyperlink to move to the next resource in
						the sequence. While this model of navigation is effective, it is also disruptive for immersive
						reading &#8212; it forces users to disengage from the content and perform the actions necessary
						to activate the links. It is also limited to media types that support hyperlinks.</p>

					<p>The <a>default reading order</a> provides an enhancement to the hyperlink model, allowing the
						user agent to automatically move the user to the next resource when a more natural action
						occurs, like a swipe across the screen. It is similar conceptually and functionally to the
							<code>link</code> element's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#sec-link-types"
								><code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> relationships</a>&#160;[[!html]].</p>

				<h4>Reading State</h4>

				<p class="issue" data-number="145"></p>

				<section>
					<h5>Short description</h5>
					<p> The user must be able to leave the Web Publication and return to it at the last position they
						left from. The User Agent must retain the reading position, based on the last known position of
						the reader in the web publication. The position should be based on the reader's position in the
						file, within the reading order. </p>
					<p> The user agent may retain reading state if the web publication is revised. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Affordances</h5>
					<p> The navigation of the web publication should be defined in the <a>Default Reading Order</a>
						required by the Information Set. </p>
					<p> User Agents should not have to set the reading state in the following type of resources: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>External Links (i.e. a link to google.com)</li>
						<li>Data references (i.e. a linked CSV file)</li>
						<li>Multimedia content (i.e. a video)</li>
					</ul>

					<p> Reading state should only apply to content documents listed as being within the bounds of the
						Web Publication. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Examples</h5>
					<p> Example 1:<br /> Sarah is reading a long article on her way to work. She arrives before she has
						finished, but wants to continue from the place she left off. The user agent should remember her
						reading state for the next time she opens the publication. </p>

					<h5>Testing</h5>
					<p> If a tester opens a web publication in a WP-aware UA, moves ahead in the publication, closes the
						reader, then reopens it, they should be returned to the last known reading state. </p>

			<h3>Web Publication Locators</h3>

			<p class="ednote"> The document referred from this section, i.e., Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]], has been recently renamed. Its previous was "Locators for Web
				Publication". The terminology used in this section has to be realigned with the name change. </p>

			<p>Locators are used to identify, locate, retrieve, and/or reference locations and content fragments within
					<a>Web Publications</a> (e.g., for address(es), bookmarks, and annotations). Locators traditionally
				take the form of fragment identifiers&#160;[[rfc3986]], where the portion of a <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> preceded by a number sign character (<code>#</code>)
				identifies a specific position within the referenced resource.</p>

			<p>For some use cases, it is essential to identify and reference a <a>Web Publication</a> resource—or a
				location in or a segment of a resource—in the scope or context of the Web Publication to which it
				belongs. A traditional fragment identifier cannot satisfy this requirement, since only the <abbr
					title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the constituent resource containing the location or
				content fragment of interest is expressed. The Web Annotation Extensions for Web
				Publications&#160;[[!wpub-ann]] document, based on the Web Annotation Model&#160;[[!annotation-model]],
				addresses this issue by providing the means to express both the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
					>URL</abbr> of the resource and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the Web
				Publication.</p>

			<p>Web Publication Locators also address the problem of referencing into a resource that was not authored
				with such a need in mind. A fragment identifier can only reference elements with explicit identifiers
				and locations with explicit anchor points. Web Publication Locators include a variety of selectors that
				work with the general structures and content of a resource (e.g., text selectors, <abbr
					title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selectors).</p>

			<p class="ednote">As Web Publication Locators currently rely on a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"
					>JSON</abbr>-based expression syntax, it is not yet clear how much of this syntax can be translated
				to a fragment identifier. This may limit the usefulness beyond expressions that are also <abbr
					title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-based (e.g., outside of annotations or
				bookmarks).</p>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>Illustrate with example of an easy to understand Web Publication Locator, such as might be used in
					annotating a simple Web Publication.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The semantics of Web Publication Locators are a mapping and extension of the Web Annotation Data
				Model&#160;[[annotation-model]] and Vocabulary&#160;[[annotation-vocab]] for describing and referencing
				a segment of a Web resource. As a result, Web Publication Locators provide the expressiveness needed for
				a broad range of annotation and bookmarking use cases. Additionally, Web Publication Locators provide a
				way to identify and reference a location within a Web Publication (i.e., as distinct from identifying
				and referencing a content fragment consisting of a span of characters or bytes). A Web Publication
				Locator can be used to identify, retrieve and/or reference a fragment of a Web Publication that spans
				multiple resources. </p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In composing a Web Publication Locator, use the <a>canonical identifier</a> of the Web Publication in
					preference to any alternative addresses. Such use facilitates the collation of Web Publication
					Locators associated with a particular Web Publication. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators"
						>URLs</abbr> of Web Publication resources appearing in a Web Publication Locator should match
					the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URL</abbr> of the resource provided in the <abbr
						title="information set"><a>infoset</a></abbr>.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Although a Web Publication manifest is authored as [[json-ld]], user agents process this information
					into an internal data structure representing the infoset in order to utilize the properties. The
					exact manner in which this processing occurs, and how the data is used internally, is user
					agent-dependent. To ensure interoperability when exposing the infoset items, however, this appendix
					defines a common, abstract representation of the data structures using the standard formalism of the
					Web Interface Definition Language [[webidl-1]] which can express the expected names, datatypes, and
					possible restrictions for each member of the infoset. (A WebIDL representation can be mapped onto
					ECMAScript, C, or other programming languages.)</p>
