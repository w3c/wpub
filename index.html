			<p>This first public working draft provides a preliminary outline of a Web Publication. Many details are under
				active consideration within the Publishing Working Group and are subject to change. The most prominent known
				issues have been identified in this document and links provided to comment on them.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section>
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>For millenia now, the written word has been the primary means of encoding and sharing ideas and
					information. The publication as a bounded edition, made public, has been used to carry intellectual and
					artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals, magazines, newspapers, articles,
					laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos, manuals, and albums of all
					sorts.</p>

				<p>More recently, with the advent of the information age, print has been ceding ground to digital, and the
					Web has become a major forum for the public dissemination of ideas. But the Web is unbounded: information
					and resources are only loosely connected through hyperlinks. While this model has helped the Web thrive
					in many areas, it has proven problematic for traditional information publishing—users often cannot access
					works in their entirety, especially when offline, and have not been able to easily access, compile and
					download content for curation and personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of
					non-Web document formats to redress these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready
					content and alternative offline renditions to ensure publications are fully available.</p>

				<p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
					of both models—the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
					accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
					that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
					work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>
			</section>

			<!-- <section id="nature">
				<h3>Web Publications</h3>

				<p>The act of publishing involves obtaining resources, organizing them into a publication and making that
					publication available on a Web server. In doing so, the publisher establishes the interconnectedness that
					binds the resources into a single work. This process also provides an origin for the Web Publication and
					a URL that uniquely identifies it, giving provenance to the work.</p>

				<p>The establishment of this discoverable and identifiable collection is what enables users to access their
					content without concern for whether they are online or offline. The user agent can cache the resources
					ensuring that the Web Publication is available and functional while offline, providing the user, as much
					as possible, a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network
					connection.</p>

				<p>The Web Publication introduces the concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the
					constituent resources of the publication. The manifest includes metadata that describes the publication
					as a whole, as it has an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources. The metadata and manifest
					also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication also provides a default ordering of its primary constituent resources, although that
					order may be changed by user interaction or scripting. The user is able to access any primary resource
					directly via navigation provided by the publication itself or via the user agent.</p>

			<section id="terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt><dfn>Default Reading Order</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>The default reading order is a specific progression through the <a>primary resources</a> defined in
						the <a>manifest</a> by the creator of a <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>
						<p>A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such interaction
							the default reading order defines the expected progression from one primary resource to the
							next.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Manifests">Manifest</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A manifest represents structured information about a <a>Web Publication</a>, such as informative
						metadata, a list of all <a data-lt="primary resource">primary</a> and <a>secondary resources</a>, and
						the <a>default reading order</a>.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Primary Resources">Primary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A primary resource is one that is listed in the <a>default reading order</a> of a <a>Web
						Publication</a>.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Secondary Resources">Secondary Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A secondary resource is one that is required for the processing or rendering of a <a>primary
						resource</a>.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publications">Web Publication</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A Web Publication is a collection of one or more <a>primary resources</a>, organized together through
						a <a>manifest</a> into a single logical work with a <a>default reading order</a>. The Web Publication
						is uniquely identifiable and presentable using Open Web Platform technologies.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publication Canonical Identifier">Web Publication Canonical Identifier</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A Web Publication canonical identifier is assigned to a Web Publication by the publisher.
						It SHOULD be the Web Publication Address. If not, it MUST be possible to
						make a 1-to-1 mapping to the Web Publication Address. If a [[!URL]] it MAY be used as the
						value of the href attribute of a canonical link element (i.e., a link element with a
						rel='canonical' attribute).</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publication Identifier">Web Publication Identifier</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A Web Publication identifier is metadata that is intended to be used to refer to a Web Publication
						in a persistent and unambiguous manner. URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, PURLs are all examples of
						identifiers frequently used in publishing.</p></dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publication Address">Web Publication Address</dfn></dt>
					<dd><p>A Web Publication Address is a [[!URL]] which represents the location of a
						Web Publication and enables the retrieval of a representation of the manifest of the Web
						Publication.</p></dd>

				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication is conformant to this specification if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST have at least one <a>primary resource</a>.</li>
					<li>It MUST have a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to all normative requirements defined in <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p id="ua-conformance">A user agent is conformant to this specification if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST be capable of processing and interpreting the manifest, as defined in <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>.</li>

					<h4>Identifier Metadata</h4>
					<p>When published, a Web Publication SHOULD be assigned a canonical identifier. This canonical identifier MUST be unique
						to the Web Publication and, if assigned, MUST be included in the Web Publication manifest. The Identifying URL
						(i.e., the canonical identifier if it is a URL or the locator mapped from the canonical identifier) MUST enable
						the retrieval of a representation of the manifest of the Web Publication. The Identifying URL does not preclude
						the creation and use of other identifiers and / or locators to retrieve a representation of a Web Publication
						in whole or part.</p>
					<div class="note">The Identifying URL can also be used as value for an identifier link relation
						[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandesompel-identifier-00#section-3.1]].</div>
