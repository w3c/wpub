			<p>The primary objective of this specification is to define requirements for the production of <a>Web
					Publications</a>. In doing so, it also defines a framework for creating packaged publication
				formats, such as EPUB and audiobooks, where a pathway to the Web is highly desirable but not necessarily
				the primary method of interchange or consumption.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<p>Many details of this draft are under active consideration within the Publishing Working Group and are
				subject to change. The most prominent known issues have been identified in this document and links
				provided to comment on them.</p>

			<p>The most significant change to this draft is the splitting of the manifest from the requirements for Web
				Publications so that it can serve as a model for packaged formats that desire a slimmer set of default
				requirements.</p>

			<p>The Publishing Working Group is actively producing proofs of concept of Web Publications and the
				technologies required to process them. For a list of these activities, please refer to the <a
					href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/experiments/index.html">experiments page</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification defines three key concepts:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>a general manifest format to describe publications;</li>
					<li>a concrete format using the manifest to represent publications on the Web (<a>Web
							Publications</a>); and</li>
					<li>the rules for using the manifest as the basis for modular extensions that desire a pathway to
						the Web.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>This specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of the publications that can be
					produced—any type of work that can be represented using Web technologies is in scope. It is also
					designed to be adaptable to the needs of specific areas of publishing, such as audiobook production,
					and encourages a modular approach for creating specializations.</p>

				<p>As much as possible, this specification leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to achieve
					its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness — on and off the Web — without changing
					the way that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, this specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that conforming publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as
					the Web evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific dated
					versions).</p>

				<p>This specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures for the
					consumption of Web Publications, or any format derived therefrom. While a primary goal is that
					traditional Web user agents (browsers) will be able to consume Web Publications, this should not
					limit the capabilities of any other possible type of user agent (e.g., applications, whether
					standalone or running within a user agent, or even Web Publications that include their own user
					interface). As a result, the specification does not attempt to architect required solutions for
					situations whose expected outcome will vary depending on the nature of the user agent and the
					expectations of the user (e.g., how to prompt to initiate a Web Publication, or at what point or how
					much of a Web Publication to cache for offline use).</p>

				<p>This specification does not define how user agents are expected to render Web Publications. Details
					about the types of afforances that user agents can provide to enhance the reading experience for
					users are instead defined in [[PWP-UCR]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="org" class="informative">
				<h3>Organization</h3>

				<p>This specification organized into three distinct parts, each of which builds on the previous:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><a href="#manifest">Part I — Publication Manifest</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first part of this specification defines a general manifest format for expressing
							information about a <a>digital publication</a>. It uses [[schema.org]] metadata augmented to
							include various structural properties about publications, and is serialized in [[JSON-LD]].
							This definition is designed to be the basis for all the specific implementations of digital
							publications. It allows for interoperability between the formats while accommodating
							variances in the information that needs to be expressed. The actual manifest requirements
							for a digital publication format are defined by its respective specification.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#webpub">Part II — Web Publications</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The second part of this specification details the Web Publications format for defining and
							deploying publications on the Web. It explains the requirements for expressing the Web
							Publication manifest, as well as various implementation details such as the primary entry
							page and the table of contents. Web Publications are the Web deployment format for all
							digital publications based on a Publication Manifest, so all such extensions have to remain
							compatible with the requirements defined in this section.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><a href="#extensions">Part III — Modular Extensions</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The third part of this specification defines how create new packaged digital publication
							formats using the Publication Manifest model. While such formats are not required to be
							conforming Web Publications in their native state, it has to be possible to create content
							that can conform to both requirements.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section id="terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined by the W3C Note "Publishing and Linking on the
					Web"&#160;[[publishing-linking]], including, in particular, <a class="externalDFN"

					>address</a>.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="digital publications|digital publication's">Digital Publication</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The term digital publication is used to refer to the encoding of a publication in any format
							that conforms to this specification, whether a <a>Web Publication</a> or a <a
								href="#extensions">modular extension</a>. All such digital publications share the common
								<a>manifest</a> format, but differ in their structural and content requirements.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="identifiers">Identifier</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>An identifier is metadata that can be used to refer to <a class="externalDFN"

					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn>Non-empty</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>For the purposes of this specification, non-empty is used to refer to an element, attribute

							normalization, where whitespace normalization rules are defined per the host format.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="URLs">URL</dfn>

			<h2>PART I: Publication Manifest</h2>

			<section id="manifest-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>A <a>digital publication</a> is described by its <a>manifest</a>, which provides a set of properties
					expressed using the JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]] format (a variant of JSON&#160;[[ecma-404]] for linked
					data).</p>

				<p>The manifest includes both descriptive properties about the publication, such as its title and
					author, as well as information about the nature and structure of the publication.</p>

				<p>This section describes the construction requirements for manifests, and outlines the general set of
					properties for use with them.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="manifest-authored-canonical" class="informative">
				<h3>Authored and Canonical Manifests</h3>

				<p>Depending on the state of a <a>digital publication</a>, its manifest exists in one of two forms:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="authored publication manifest">Authored Manifest</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Authored Publication Manifest is the serialization of the manifest that the author
							provides with the digital publication (i.e., prior to be digital publication being processed
							by a user agent). Note that the author does not have to be human; a machine could
							automatically produce authored manifests for digital publications.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="canonical manifest|canonical publication manifest">Canonical Manifest</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Canonical Publication Manifest is a version of the manifest created by user agents when
							they <a href="#processing-manifest">process the authored manifest</a> and remove all
							possible ambiguities and incorporate any missing values that can be inferred from another
							source.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>It is possible that an authored manifest is the equivalent of the canonical manifest if there are no
					ambiguities or missing information, but a canonical manifest only exists after a user agent has
					inspected the authored manifest as part of the process of obtaining it.</p>

				<p>This part of the specification describes the requirements for creating an authored manifest,
					regardless of the format of the digital publication. Rules for constructing a canonical manifest
					from the authored manifest are defined for each specific implementation (e.g., the process for
						<a>Web Publications</a> is described in <a href="#canonical-manifest"></a>).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="webidl">
				<h3>WebIDL</h3>

				<section id="webidl-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Although a <a>digital publication</a>'s manifest is authored as [[json-ld]], a user agent
						processes this information into an internal data structure in order to utilize the properties.
						The exact manner in which this processing occurs, and how the data is used internally, is user
						agent-dependent.</p>

					<p>To ensure interoperability when exposing the items, this specification defines an abstract
						representation of the data structures using the Web Interface Definition Language (WebIDL)
						[[webidl-1]]. The WebIDL definitions express the expected names, datatypes, and possible
						restrictions for each member of the manifest. (A WebIDL representation can be mapped onto
						ECMAScript, C, or other programming languages.)</p>

					<p class="note">Authors of digital publications are encouraged to review these definitions, but they
						are not necessary to understand.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="webidl-wpm">
					<h4>The <dfn><code>PublicationManifest</code></dfn> Dictionary</h4>

					<p>The <code>PublicationManifest</code> dictionary is the [[!webidl-1]] representation of the
						collection of manifest properties. WebIDL definitions are also provided at the end of each
						property that belongs to the dictionary — these represent the members of the
							<code>PublicationManifest</code> dictionary.</p>

					<pre class="idl" id="wpm">
dictionary PublicationManifest {

};</pre>

					<p class="note">Refer to <a href="#idl-index"></a> for a complete listing of the
							<code>PublicationManifest</code> dictionary.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="manifest-context">
				<h3>Manifest Contexts</h3>

				<p>A <a>digital publication's</a>
					<a>manifest</a> MUST start by setting the JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]]. The context has the
					following two major components:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the [[!schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
					<li>the publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context</code></li>
				</ul>

				<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

				<p>The publication context document adds features to the properties defined in Schema.org (e.g., the
					requirement for the <a href="https://schema.org/creator">creator</a> property to be order
					preserving).</p>

				<p class="ednote">As part of the continuous contacts with Schema.org the additional features defined in
					the publication context file could migrate to the core Schema.org vocabulary.</p>

				<p class="note">Although Schema.org is often referenced using the <code>http</code> URI scheme, <a
						href="https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19">the vocabulary is being migrated</a> to use the
					secure <code>https</code> scheme as its default. This specification requires the use of
						<code>https</code> when referencing Schema.org in the manifest.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="publication-types">
				<h4>Publication Types</h4>

				<p>A <a>digital publication's</a>
					<a>manifest</a> MUST define its <dfn>Publication Type</dfn> using the <code
						data-dfn-for="PublicationManifest"><dfn>type</dfn></code> term&#160;[[!json-ld]]. The type MAY
					be mapped onto <a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"
					><code>CreativeWork</code></a>&#160;[[!schema.org]].</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to CreativeWork.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "type"     : "CreativeWork"
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

				<p>Schema.org also includes a number of more specific subtypes of <code>CreativeWork</code>, such as <a
						href="https://schema.org/Article"><code>Article</code></a>, <a href="https://schema.org/Book"
							><code>Book</code></a>, <a href="https://schema.org/TechArticle"
						><code>TechArticle</code></a>, and <a href="https://schema.org/Course"><code>Course</code></a>.
					These MAY be used instead of, or in addition to, <code>CreativeWork</code>.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to Book.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "type"     : "Book"
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

				<p>Each Schema.org type defines a set of properties that are valid for use with it. To ensure that the
					manifest can be validated and processed by Schema.org aware processors, the manifest SHOULD contain
					only the properties associated with the selected type.</p>

				<p>If properties from more than one type are needed, the manifest MAY include multiple type
					declarations.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="A publication that combines properties from both Book and VisualArtwork.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "type"     : ["Book", "VisualArtwork"],
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

				<p>User agents SHOULD NOT fail to process manifests that are not valid to their declared Schema.org
					type(s).</p>

				<p class="note">Refer to the Schema.org site for the complete <a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"
						>list of <code>CreativeWork</code> subtypes</a>.</p>

				<pre class="idl">

				<h3>Properties</h3>

				<section id="properties-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>A <a>digital publication's</a>
						<a>manifest</a> is defined by a set of properties that describe the basic information a user
						agent requires to process and render the publication. These properties are categorized as
						followed:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Descriptive properties describe aspects of a digital publication, such as its <a
									href="#pub-title">title</a>, <a href="#creators">creator</a>, and <a
									href="#language-and-dir">language</a>. These properties are primarily drawn from <a
									href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a> and its <a
									href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">hosted
								extensions</a>&#160;[[schema.org]], so they map to one or several Schema.org properties
								and inherit their syntax and semantics. (The following property categories typically do
								not have Schema.org equivalents, so are defined specifically for publications.)</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							<a href="#resource-categorization-properties">resource categorization</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Resource categorization properties describe or identify common sets of resources, such as
								the <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order"
									>default reading order</a>. These properties refer to one or more resources, such as
								HTML documents, images, script files, and separate metadata files.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p class="note">The categorization of properties exists only to simplify comprehension of their
						purpose; the groupings have no relevance outside this specification (i.e., the properties are
						not actually grouped together in the manifest).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Each manifest item drawn from schema.org identifies the property it maps to and includes its
							defining type in parentheses. Properties are often available in many types, however, as a
							result of the schema.org inheritance model. Refer to each property definition for more
							detailed information about where it is valid to use.</p>

						<p>Schema.org additionally includes a large number of properties that, though relevant for
							publishing, are not mentioned in this specification — publication authors can use any of
							these properties. This document defines only the minimal set of manifest items.</p>
					</div>

					<p class="ednote">There are discussion on whether a best practices document would be created,
						referring to more schema.org terms. If so, it should be linked from here.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="properties-value-categories">
					<h4>Value Categories</h4>

					<p>This section describes the categories of values that can be used with properties of the
						Publication Manifest.</p>

					<section id="value-literal">
						<h5>Literals</h5>

						<p>Some <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> properties expect a literal text string as
							their value &#8212; one that is not language-dependent, such as a code value or date. These
							values are expressed as [[!json]] strings.</p>

						<p>Literal values are not changed <a href="#canonical-manifest">during canonicalization of the
								manifest</a>, unlike other values which might be, for example, converted to objects.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="value-number">
						<h5>Numbers</h5>

						<p> Some <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> properties expect a number as their value.
							These values are expressed as [[!json]] numbers. </p>
					</section>


					<section id="value-objects">
						<h5>Explicit and Implied Objects</h5>

						<p>Various manifest properties are expected to be expressed as [[!json]]&#160;objects. Although
							the use of objects is usually recommended, it is also acceptable to use string values that
							are interpreted as objects depending on the context. The exact mapping of text values to
							objects is part of the property or object definitions.</p>

						<section id="value-localizable-string">
							<h5>Localizable Strings</h5>

							<p>Some <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> properties expect a localizable text
								string as their value. These values are expressed either as:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>a single string value;</li>
								<li>an anonymous object with a <code>value</code> property containing a the property's
									text and a <code>language</code> property that identifies the language of the
									text.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>In the case of single string values, these represent a implied object whose
									<code>value</code> property is the string's text and whose language will be
								determined from other information in the manifest.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="value-object-entity">
							<h6>Entities</h6>

							<p>A common case of implied objects in the Publication Manifest properties set is for <a
									href="#creators">creators</a>. The entities responsible for the various aspects of
								creation are expressed as [[!schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a>
								and/or <a href="https://schema.org/Organization">Organization</a> objects. To simplify
								authoring, however, a simple string value can be used for the entity's name. In this
								case, the entity is assumed to represent a Person.</p>

							<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of a Person object.">
								<p>The following author name is expressed as a text string:</p>

								<pre>
{
    "author" : "Herman Melville",
    &#8230;
}</pre>
								<p>but, in the context of <a href="#creators">creators</a>, it is equivalent to:</p>

								<pre>
{
    "author" : {
        "type" : "Person"
        "name" : "Herman Melville"
    },
    &#8230;
}</pre>
								<p>(See <a href="#creators"></a> for further details.)</p>
							</aside>
						</section>

						<section id="value-link">
							<h5>Links</h5>

							<p>With the exception of the <a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>,
								manifest properties typically link to one or more resources. When a property requires a
								link value, the link MUST be expressed in one of the following two ways:</p>

							<ol>
								<li>as a string encoding the (absolute or relative) URL of the resources&#160;[[!url]];
									or</li>
								<li>as an instance of a <a href="#publication-link-def"><code>LinkedResource</code>
										object</a> that can be used to express the URL, the media type, and other
									characteristics of the target resource.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>In the case of single string values, these represent an implied
									<code>LinkedResource</code> object whose <code>url</code> property is set to that
								string value.</p>

							<pre class="example" title="Resource list that includes one link using a relative URL as a string ('datatypes.svg') and two that display the various properties of the a LinkedResource object">
{
    &#8230;
    "resources" : [
        "datatypes.svg",

						<p>Both <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string">relative</a> and <a
								href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string">absolute</a> URL strings MAY be
							used in the manifest.</p>

						<p>In the case of relative URL strings, these are resolved to <a
								href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string">absolute URL strings</a> using a
								<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-base-url">base URL</a>&#160;[[!url]].</p>

						<p>The base URL for relative URLs is determined as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>In the case of an <a href="#wp-manifest-embedding">embedded manifest</a>, the base URL
								is the <a data-cite="!html#the-base-element">document base URL</a>&#160;[[!html]] of the
									<a>primary entry page</a> of the publication;</li>
							<li>In the case of a <a href="#wp-manifest-linking">linked manifest</a>, the base URL is URL
								of the manifest resource.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>By consequence, relative URLs in embedded manifests are resolved against the URL of the
							primary entry page <em>unless</em> the page declares a base URL (i.e., in a <a
								data-cite="!html#the-base-element"><code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element</a> in its
							header).</p>

						<h5>Arrays</h5>

						<p>Some <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest properties</a> allow one or more value of their
							respective type (<a href="#value-literal">literal</a>, <a href="#value-objects">object</a>,
							or <a href="#value-url">URL</a>). As a general rule, these values can be expressed as
							[[!json]]&#160;arrays. When the property value is an array with a single element, however,
							the array syntax MAY be omitted.</p>

							language that the content is expressed in (e.g., English, French, Chinese). It also has a
							natural <dfn>base direction</dfn> in which it is written — the display direction, either
							left-to-right or right-to-left.</p>

						<p>The digital publication manifest includes entries to set both these concepts, which can
							influence, for example, the behavior of a user agent (e.g., it might place a pop-up for a
							table of contents on the right hand side for publications whose natural base direction is
							right-to-left).</p>

						<p>Similarly, each natural language property value in the manifest (e.g., <a href="#pub-title"
								>title</a>, <a href="#creators">creators</a>) is a <a href="#value-localizable-string"
								>localizable string</a>.</p>

						<p class="note">For more information about localized strings on the Web, refer to
							[[string-meta]].</p>

						<p>The natural language and base direction can be set for both the <a
								href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir">publication</a> and the <a
								href="#manifest-specific-language-and-dir">natural language properties values</a> of the
							manifest.</p>

						<p>If a user agent requires the language and one is not available in the authored manifest
							(either globally or specifically for that property), or the obtained value is invalid, the
							user agent MAY attempt to determine the language when <a href="#canonical-manifest"
								>generating the canonical manifest</a>. This specification does not mandate how such a
							language tag is created. The user agent might:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>use the <a>non-empty</a> language declaration of the manifest;</li>
							<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default
									reading order</a>;</li>
							<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>No default values are specified for the <a>language</a> or the default <a>base
							direction</a>.</p>

							<h6>Global Language and Direction</h6>

							<p>The manifest MAY include global language and base direction declarations for the
								publication using the following properties.</p>

							<table class="zebra">

									<tr>

										<th>Required Value</th>

							<p>The natural language MUST be a tag that conforms to&#160;[[!bcp47]], while the <dfn
									data-lt="TextDirection">base language direction</dfn> MUST have one of the following
								values:</p>

							<ul data-dfn-for="TextDirection">
								<li><code><dfn>ltr</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly
									directionally set to left-to-right text;</li>
								<li><code><dfn>rtl</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly
									directionally set to right-to-left text;</li>
								<li><code><dfn>auto</dfn></code> indicates that the textual values are explicitly
									directionally set to the direction of the first character with a strong
									directionality, following the rules of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
									[[!bidi]].</li>
							</ul>

							<p>When specified, these properties are also used as defaults for textual values in the
								manifest.</p>

							<p class="note">It is important to differentiate the language <em>of the publication</em>
								from the language and the base direction of the individual resources that compose it. If
								such resources are, for example, in HTML, the language and direction need to be set in
								those resources, too. The language and base direction of the publication are not
								inherited.</p>

							<p>The global language information MAY be overridden by <a
									href="#manifest-specific-language-and-dir">individual values</a>.</p>

							<p>If the manifest is <a href="#wp-manifest-embedding">embedded</a> in the primary entry
								page via a <code>script</code> element, and the manifest does not set the global
								language and/or the base direction (see <a href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir"
								></a>), the <code>lang</code> and the <code>dir</code> attributes of the
									<code>script</code> element are used as the global <a>language</a> and <a>base
									direction</a>, respectively (see the details on handling the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-lang-and-xmllang-attributes"
										><code>lang</code></a> and <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-dir-attribute"><code>dir</code></a>
								attributes in&#160;[[!html]]).</p>

							<p class="issue">It is to be discussed whether this last paragraph, i.e., inheriting values
								from <code>script</code>, should be kept.</p>

							<p class="note">If authors intend to use a manifest, or a manifest template, both as
								embedded manifest and as a separate resource, they are strongly encouraged to set these
								properties explicitly to avoid interference of the containing <code>script</code>
								element in case of embedding.</p>

							<p>It is possible to set the language for any textual value in the manifest. This
								information MUST be set as a <dfn data-lt="LocalizableString">localizable string</dfn>,
								i.e., using the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/#string-internationalization"
										><code>value</code> and <code>language</code> terms</a> (instead of a simple

}
</pre>
							<p>The value of the <code data-dfn-for="LocalizableString"><dfn>language</dfn></code> MUST
								be set to a language code as defined in [[!bcp47]].</p>

							<p>When used in a context of localizable texts, a simple string value is a shorthand for a
									<a>localizable string</a>, with the <code data-dfn-for="LocalizableString"
										><dfn>value</dfn></code> set to the string value, and the language set to the
								value of the <a href="#manifest-default-language-and-dir"><code>inLanguage</code></a>
								property, if applicable, and unset otherwise. In other words, the previous example is

							<pre class="example" title="Setting the default language of an author name to French">
{
    "@context"   : ["https://schema.org","https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],

    &#8230;
    "author"     : "Marcel Proust",
}
</pre>
							<p>(See also <a href="#value-objects"></a>.)</p>

							<p>It is <em>not</em> possible to set the direction explicitly for a value.</p>

							<p class="note"> Setting the direction for a natural text value is currently not possible in
								JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]]. In case the JSON-LD community, as well as the schema.org
								community, introduces such a feature, future versions of this specification may extend
								the ability of manifests to include this.</p>

							<p>When using manifests with bidirectional text, user agents SHOULD identify the base
								direction of any given natural language value by scanning the text for the first strong
								directional character. Once the base direction has been identified, user agents MUST
								determine the appropriate rendering and display of natural language values according to
								the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm&#160;[[!bidi]]. This could require wrapping
								additional control characters or markup around the string prior to display, in order to
								apply the base direction. (See <a href="#app-bidi-examples"></a>.)</p>

						<p>Linked resources are typically made available to user agents to augment or enhance the
							processing or rendering, such as:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>a privacy policy or license that the user agent can offer a link to from a shelf;</li>
							<li>a metadata record that the user agent can use to discover and display more information
								about the publication;</li>
							<li>a dictionary of terms the user agent can process to provide enhanced language help;</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Links can also be used to identify resources used in the online rendering of a publication,
							but that are not essential to include when the publication is taken offline or packaged
							(e.g., to minimize the size). These include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>large font files that enhance the appearance of the publication but are not vital to its
								display (i.e., a fallback font will suffice);</li>
							<li>third-party scripts that are not intended for use when a publication is taken offline or
								packaged (e.g., tracking scripts).</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The <code>links</code> list SHOULD include resources necessary to render a linked resource
							(e.g., scripts, images, style sheets).</p>

						<p>Resources listed in the <code>links</code> list MUST NOT be listed in the <a
								href="#default-reading-order">default reading order</a> or <a href="#resource-list"
								>resource list</a>.</p>

						<p>User agents MAY ignore linked resources, and are not required to take them offline with a
							publication. These resources SHOULD NOT be included when packaging a publication.</p>

					<h4>Extensibility</h4>

					<p>The manifest is designed to provide a basic set of properties for use by user agents in
						presenting and rendering a <a>digital publication</a>, but MAY be extended in the following
						ways:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>by the provision of <a href="#extensibility-linked-records">linked metadata
							records</a>.</li>
						<li>through the inclusion of <a href="#extensibility-manifest-properties">additional properties
								in the manifest</a>;</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Although both methods are valid, the use of linked records is RECOMMENDED.</p>

					<p>This specification does not define how such additional properties are compiled, stored or exposed
						by user agents in their internal representation of the manifest. A user agent MAY ignore some or
						all extended properties.</p>

					<section id="extensibility-linked-records">
						<h4>Linked records</h4>

						<p>Extending the manifest through links to a record, such as an ONIX&#160;[[onix]] or

									><code>LinkedResource</code></a> object, where:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the <code>rel</code> value of the <a href="#publication-link-def"
										><code>LinkedResource</code></a> SHOULD include a relevant identifier defined by
								IANA or by other organizations; if the link record contains descriptive metadata it MUST
								include the <code>describedby</code> (IANA) identifier; </li>
							<li>the value of the <code>encodingFormat</code> in the link MUST use the MIME media
								type&#160;[[!rfc2046]] defined for that particular type of record, if applicable.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Linked records MUST be included in the <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> when they

						<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>

						<p>Users often have the legal right to know and control what information is collected about

				<h3>Publication Manifest Lifecycle</h3>

				<section id="lifecycle-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>This section describes the steps a user agent follows to process an <a>authored manifest</a> into
						an internal representation of the data structure it contains.</p>

					<p>The first step in this process is to obtain the manifest, the exact steps by which to do so are
						typically defined by each <a>digital publication</a> format.</p>

					<p>The process then involves generating a <a data-lt="canonical manifest">canonical form</a> of the
						manifest, which is a representation that adds any missing data not explicitly authored (e.g.,
						information could be gleaned from a containing HTML document if the manifest is embedded inside
						a <code>script</code> tag).</p>

					<p>After a canonical manifest is generated, the data is put through a final set of post-processing
						steps to check its validity, ultimately resulting in a data structure that the user agent can
						use.</p>

					<p>Within this process are various extension points that allow <a>digital publication</a> formats to
						enhance the basic requirements for their own specialized needs and audiences.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="processing-manifest">
					<h4>Processing a Manifest</h4>

					<p>The <dfn data-lt="processing the manifest|processing a manifest|process a manifest">steps for
							processing a manifest</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm, if
						successful, returns a <a>processed manifest</a>; otherwise, it terminates prematurely and
						returns nothing. In the case of nothing being returned, the user agent MUST ignore the manifest
						declaration.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Let <var>text</var> be a UTF-8 string containing the manifest that is the result of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>following the specific rules for obtaining a manifest defined by an application of
									this format; or</li>
								<li>reading the body of a manifest file provided as direct input to this algorithm.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Let <var>json</var> be the result of <a data-cite="!ecmascript#sec-json.parse">parsing</a>
							<var>text</var>. If <a data-cite="!ecmascript#sec-json.parse">parsing</a> throws an error,
							terminate this algorithm. </li>

						<li>If Type(<var>json</var>) is not <code>Object</code>, terminate this algorithm. </li>

						<li>Let <var>canonical manifest</var> be the <a>canonical manifest</a> derived from
								<var>json</var>, using the values of <var>json</var>, <var>base</var>, and
								<code>Document</code> as input to the algorithm described in <a
								href="#canonical-manifest"></a>. </li>

						<li>Check whether the <var>canonical manifest</var> fulfills the minimal requirements for a
							Publication Manifest, namely: <ul>
								<li>The JSON-LD context is set (see <a href="#manifest-context"></a>)</li>
								<li>The Publication type is set (see <a href="#publication-types"></a>)</li>
								<li>The Publication address is set (see <a href="#address"></a>)</li>
							</ul> If any of these requirements is not fulfilled, terminate the algorithm. </li>

						<li>Let <var>processed manifest</var> be the result of <a>post-processing a canonical
								manifest</a> given <var>canonical manifest</var>. </li>

						<li>Return <var>processed manifest</var>. </li>
					</ol>

					<p class="note"> The algorithm does not describes how error and warning messages should be reported.
						This is implementation dependent.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="canonical-manifest">
					<h4>Generating the Canonical Manifest</h4>

					<p>The steps to convert a Publication Manifest into a Canonical Manifest are given by the following
						algorithm. The algorithm takes the following arguments:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the <var>manifest</var>: the JSON object that represent the <a>manifest</a></li>
						<li>the <var>base</var>: URL string, that represents the base URL for the manifest</li>
						<li>the <var>document</var>: <a data-cite="!html#the-document-object">HTML Document (DOM)
								Node</a>, representing the HTML document the manifest is embedded within (i.e., when it
							is not a standalone document). </li>
					</ul>

					<p> The steps of the algorithm are described below. As an abuse of notation, <var>P["term"]</var>
						refers to the value in the object <var>P</var> for the label <var>"term"</var>, where
							<var>P</var> is either <var>manifest</var>, or an object appearing within
							<var>manifest</var> (e.g., a <var>Person</var>). The algorithm replaces or adds some terms
						to <var>manifest</var>; the replacement terms are expressed in JSON syntax as <code class="json"
							>{"term":"value"}</code>. </p>

					<ol>
						<li>let <var>lang</var> string represent the default language, set to: <ul>
								<li>the value of the <a data-cite="!html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes"
											><code>lang</code> value</a> for the <code>script</code> element in
										<code>document</code> (when set); or </li>
								<li><code>undefined</code> otherwise</li>
							</ul>
							<details>
								<summary> Explanation </summary>
								<p>This value is used in <a href="#can-set-lang">the step on language</a> below.</p>
							</details>
						</li>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information
					about the Web Publication is expressed in its <a>manifest</a>, which is an implementation of the
					format defined in <a href="#manifest"></a>. The manifest is what enables user agents to understand
					the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection between its resources.</p>

				<p>The manifest includes metadata that describe the Web Publication, as a publication has an identity
					and nature beyond its constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources
					that belong to the Web Publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources
					into a single contiguous work.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication is discoverable via the presence of a link to the manifest in any of its resources
					(i.e., by the use of an HTTP Link header or an HTML <code>link</code> element&#160;[[html]]). The
					linked manifest is contained either directly within the resource containing the link (in a special
					case called the <a href="#primary-entry-page">primary entry page</a>) or in a separate JSON-LD
					document.</p>

				<p>With the establishment of Web Publications, user agents can build new experiences tailored
					specifically for their unique reading needs.</p>

				<h3>Conformance Classes</h3>

				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Web Publications</a> and one for user
					agents that process them.</p>

				<p id="wp-conformance">A Web Publication conforms to this specification if it meets the following

					<li>it has a <a>manifest</a> that conforms to <a href="#wp-manifest"></a>;</li>

						Publication.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="wp-construction">
				<h3>Web Publication Construction</h3>

				<section id="wp-bounds">
					<h4>Publication Bounds</h4>

					<p>A Web Publication consists of a finite set of <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a> that
						represent its content. This extent is known as its bounds and is defined within its manifest —
						it is obtained from the union of resources listed in the <a href="#default-reading-order"
							>default reading order</a> and <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a>.</p>

					<p>To determine whether a resource is within the bounds of a Web Publication, user agents MUST
						compare the absolute URL of a resource to the absolute URLs of the resources obtained from the
						union. If the resource is identified in the enumeration, it is within the bounds of the Web
						Publication. All other resources are external to the Web Publication.</p>

					<p>Resources within the bounds of a Web Publication do not have to share the same domain.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wp-resources">
					<h4>Resources</h4>

					<p>A <a>Web Publication</a> MUST include at least one HTML document&#160;[[!html]]—the <a>primary
							entry page</a>.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, a Web Publication MAY references resources of any media type, both in the <a>default
							reading order</a> and as dependencies of other resources.</p>

					<p class="note">When adding resources to a Web Publication, consider support in user agents. The use
						of progressive enhancement techniques and the provision of fallback content, as appropriate,
						will ensure a more consistent reading experience for users regardless of their preferred user
						agent.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="primary-entry-page">
					<h4>Primary Entry Page</h4>

					<p>The <dfn>primary entry page</dfn> represents the preferred starting <a href="#wp-resources"
							>resource</a> for a Web Publication and enables discovery of its <a>manifest</a>. It is the
						resource that is returned when accessing the Web Publication's <a>address</a>, and MUST be
						included in either the <a>default reading order</a> or the <a>resource list</a>.</p>

					<p>Although any resource can link to the manifest, the primary entry page typically introduces the
						Web Publication and provides access to the content. It might contain all the content, in the
						case of a single-page Web Publication, or provide navigational aids to begin reading a
						multi-document Web Publication. To facilitate the user ease of consumption, the primary entry
						page SHOULD contain the <a href="#table-of-contents">table of contents</a>.</p>

					<p>It is not required that the primary entry page be included in the <a
							href="#default-reading-order">default reading order</a>, nor that it be the first document
						listed when it is included. This specification leaves the exact nature of the document
						intentionally underspecified to provide flexibility for different approaches. If a default
						reading order is not provided, however, user agents will <a href="#no-reading-order">create one
							using the primary entry page</a>.</p>

					<p>The primary entry page is the only resource in which <a href="#wp-manifest-embedding">a manifest
							can be embedded</a>. </p>

					<p>To ensure discovery of the manifest, the primary entry page MUST provide a <a
							href="#wp-manifest-linking">link to the manifest</a>. It is RECOMMENDED to <a
							href="#wp-manifest-embedding">embed</a> the manifest in the primary entry page, but the
						manifest MAY be external to, and linked from, it.</p>

					<p class="note">Embedding is the preferred option as search engines might only process schema.org
						metadata in JSON-LD format when it is embedded in an HTML page.</p>

					<p>The address of the primary entry page is also the <a>canonical identifier</a> for the Web
						Publication (i.e., it serves as its unique identifier).</p>

					<p>In certain cases where information has been omitted from the manifest, user agents will sometimes
						use the primary entry page as a fallback source of information (see <a href="#language-and-dir"
							>language and base direction</a> and <a href="#wp-title">title</a>).</p>

					<p>The table of contents provides a hierarchical list of links that reflects the structural outline
						of the major sections of the Web Publication.</p>

					<p>The table of contents is expressed via an [[!html]]&#160;element (typically a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code>
						element</a>) in one of the <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a>. This element MUST be
						identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
						"<code>doc-toc</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document —
						in <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document tree
						order</a>&#160;[[!dom]] — with that <code>role</code> value.</p>

					<p>If the table of contents is not located in the <a href="#primary-entry-page">primary entry
							page</a>, the manifest SHOULD <a href="#table-of-contents">identify the resource</a> that
						contains the structure.</p>

					<pre class="example" title="If the primary entry page includes the table of contents, no reference to it in the manifest is necessary">

					<h4>Page List</h4>

					<p>The page list is a list of links that provides navigation to static page demarcation points
						within the content. These locations allow users to coordinate access into the content, but the
						exact nature of the locations is left to content creators to define. They usually correspond to
						pages of a print document which is the source of the Web Publication, but might be a purely
						digital creation added to ease navigation.</p>

					<p>The page list is expressed via an [[!html]] element (typically a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code>
						element</a>) in one of the <a href="#wp-resources">resources</a>. This element MUST be
						identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
						"<code>doc-pagelist</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the
						document — in <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document tree
						order</a>&#160;[[!dom]] — with that <code>role</code> value.</p>

					<p>If the page list is not located in the <a href="#primary-entry-page">primary entry page</a>, the
						manifest SHOULD <a href="#pagelist">identify the resource</a> that contains the structure.</p>

						<h4>Address</h4>

						<p>A Web Publication's <dfn>address</dfn> is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"
							>URL</abbr>&#160;[[!url]] that represents the <a>primary entry page</a> for the Web
							Publication. It is expressed using the <code>url</code> property.</p>

						<table class="zebra">

								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>

						<p>If the address does not resolve to an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
							document&#160;[[!html]], user agents SHOULD NOT provide access to the resource to users. A
							Web Publication MAY have more than one address, but all the addresses MUST resolve to the
							same document.</p>

						<p>The referenced document SHOULD be a resource of the Web Publication. It can be any resource,
							including one that is not listed in the <a>default reading order</a>. This document MUST
							include a <a href="#wp-manifest-linking">link to the manifest</a> to ensure a bidirectional
							linking relationship (i.e., that user agents can also locate the manifest from the document
							at the address).</p>

						<p>If the document is not a publication resource, user agents SHOULD load the first document in
							the <a>default reading order</a> when initiating the publication.</p>

						<p class="note"> To improve the usability of publications, particularly in user agents that do
							not support them, authors are encouraged to include navigation aids in the referenced
							document that facilitate consumption of the content, (e.g., provide a table of contents or a
							link to one).</p>

						<div class="note">The publication's address can also be used as value for an identifier link

						<h5>Canonical Identifier</h5>

						<p>A Web Publication's <dfn>canonical identifier</dfn> is a unique identifier that resolves to
							the preferred version of the Web Publication. It is expressed using the <code>id</code>
							property.</p>

						<table class="zebra">
							<thead>

									<td><a href="#value-url">URL</a></td>
									<td>(None)</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>

						<p class="note">Ensuring uniqueness of canonical identifiers is outside the scope of this
							specification. The actual achievable uniqueness depends on such factors as the conventions
							of the identifier scheme used and the degree of control over assignment of identifiers.</p>

						<p>The canonical identifier is intended to provide a measure of permanence above and beyond the
							Web Publication's <a href="#address">address(es)</a>. If a Web Publication is permanently
							relocated to a new URL, for example, the canonical identifier provides a way of discovering
							the new location (e.g., a <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr> registry could
							be updated with the new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or a redirect
							could be added to the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the canonical
							identifier). It is also intended to provide a means of identifying instances of the same Web
							Publication hosted at different URLs.</p>

						<p>If a URL is not provided in the manifest, or the value is an invalid URL, the Web Publication
							does not have a canonical identifier. User agents MUST NOT attempt to construct a canonical
							identifier from any other identifiers provided in the manifest for the canonical
							manifest.</p>

						<p>The specification of the canonical identifier MAY be complemented by the inclusion of
							additional types of identifiers for the Web Publication using the <a
								href="https://schema.org/identifier"><code>identifier</code>
							property</a>&#160;[[!schema.org]] and/or its subtypes.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>The <a href="default-reading-order">default reading order</a> MAY be omitted when it
								only consists of the <a>primary entry page</a>. When the default reading order is

					</section>

					<section id="wp-title">
						<h5>Title</h5>

						<p>The Web Publication <code>title</code> property extends the <a href="#pub-title">Publication
								Manifest <code>title</code> property</a> in the following ways:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If a <a href="#pub-title">title</a> is not included in the <a>authored manifest</a>, the
								user agent MUST use the value of the <a data-cite="!html#the-title-element"
										><code>title</code> element</a>&#160;[[!html]] of the Web Publication's
									<a>primary entry page</a>, if present, when generating the <a>canonical
								manifest</a>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="note">Relying on the <code>title</code> element could be semantically problematic if
							the Web Publication consists of several HTML resources (e.g., one per chapter of a book),
							because the <a data-cite="!html#the-title-element">HTML definition</a> defines this element
							as "metadata" for the enclosing HTML document, not for a collection of resources. Using this
							element is, on the other hand, preferred in the case of a Web Publication consisting of a
							single HTML document (e.g., a scholarly journal article).</p>

						<h4>Embedding</h4>

						<p>A manifest MAY be embedded only in the <a href="#primary-entry-page">primary entry page</a>.
							In this case, the manifest MUST be included in a <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element"
									><code>script</code> element</a>&#160;[[!html]] whose <code>type</code> attribute is
							set to <code>application/ld+json</code>.</p>

						<p>Additionally, the <code>script</code> element MUST include a unique identifier in an
								<code>id</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]]. This identifier ensures that the manifest <a
								href="#wp-manifest-linking">can be referenced</a>.</p>

						<pre class="example" title="A Web Publication Manifest included in an HTML document">

					<section id="wp-manifest-linking">
						<h4>Linking</h4>

						<p>With the exception of the <a>primary entry page</a>, linking a resource to its manifest is
							OPTIONAL. Including a link is encouraged whenever possible, however, as it allows user
							agents to immediately ascertain that a resource belongs to a Web Publication regardless of
							how the user reaches the resource.</p>

						<p>Links to a Web Publication Manifest MUST take one or both of the following forms:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>An HTTP <code>Link</code> header field&#160;[[!rfc5988]] with its <code>rel</code>
									parameter set to the value "<code>publication</code>".</p>
								<pre class="example">Link: &lt;https://example.com/webpub/manifest>; rel=publication</pre>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>A <code>link</code> element&#160;[[!html]] with its <code>rel</code> attribute set to
									the value "<code>publication</code>".</p>
								<pre class="example">&lt;link href="https://example.com/webpub/manifest" rel="publication"/></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>When a manifest is embedded within an HTML document, the link MUST include a fragment
							identifier that references the <code>script</code> element that contains the manifest (see
								<a href="#wp-manifest-embedding"></a>).</p>

						<pre class="example" title="Link to a manifest within the same HTML resource">
	&lt;link href="#example_manifest" rel="publication"&gt;

</pre>

						<p class="issue" data-number="132">The exact value of <code>rel</code> is still to be agreed
							upon and should be registered by IANA.</p>

						<p class="ednote">The following details might be moved to the lifecycle section in a future
							draft.</p>

						<p>When a resource links to multiple manifests, a user agent MAY choose to present one or more
							alternatives to the end user, or choose a single alternative on its own. The user agent MAY
							choose to present any manifest based upon information that it possesses, even one that is
							not explicitly listed as a parent (e.g., based upon information it calculates or acquires
							out of band). In the absence of a preference by user agent implementers, selection of the
							first manifest listed is suggested as a default.</p>

			<h2>PART III: Modular Extensions</h2>

			<section id="mod-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p> The first two parts of this specification define the cornerstones for developing additional
						<a>digital publication</a> formats that can be deployed to the Web. Various publishing
					communities (e.g., audio books, scholarly publications) MAY define extensions, also known as
						<dfn>profiles</dfn>, by <em>extending</em> the core <a href="#manifest"></a> with module
					specific terms and possibly adding new requirements. </p>

			</section>

			<section id="mod-compat">
				<h3>Compatibility Requirements</h3>

				<p> In order for a <a>digital publication</a> format to be compatible with this specification, following
					conditions MUST be met: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST adhere to the manifest format requirements defined in <a href="#manifest"></a>.</li>
					<li>The generic canonicalization steps described in <a href="#canonical-manifest"></a> MUST remain
						valid for the extended manifest. To achieve this, and if new terms are added to the general <a
							href="#manifest"></a>, then: <ul>
							<li>The term SHOULD be categorized, if applicable, to one or more of the general term
								categories used in the algorithm (e.g., <a href="#value-array">array</a> or <a
									href="#value-localizable-string">localizable string</a>). This means the relevant
								canonicalization steps will be automatically executed for those terms </li>
							<li>If necessary, the profile MAY define its own canonicalization step, to be executed as
								the <a href="#canonicalization-extension-point">last step of the general
									canonicalization algorithm</a>. Such an extra step MUST NOT invalidate the results
								of any of the steps defined for the <a href="#canonical-manifest">canonicalization
									algorithm</a> in general. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If necessary, the profile MAY define its own manifest processing step, to be executed as part of
						the steps described in <a href="#processing-manifest"></a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ednote"> Adding an example of a term added by, e.g., the audiobook profile would be a good
					idea, when available. </p>

			<h2>Machine-Processable Table of Contents</h2>

			<section id="app-toc-html-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To facilitate navigation within pages and across sites, HTML uses the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>
					[[html]] to express lists of links. Although generic in nature by default, the purpose of a
						<code>nav</code> element can be more specifically identified by use of the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#aria-role-attribute"><code>role</code> attribute</a>
					[[html]]. In particular, the <code>doc-toc</code> role from the [[dpub-aria-1.0]] vocabulary
					identifies the <code>nav</code> element as the Web Publications's <a href="#table-of-contents">table
						of contents</a>.</p>

				<p>Including an identifiable table of contents is an accessible way to produce any <a>digital
						publication</a>, but due to the flexibility of HTML markup, it also presents challenges for user
					agents trying to extract a meaningful hierarchy of links (e.g., to provide a custom view available
					from any page). To avoid duplicating the tables of contents for different uses, this section defines
					a syntax that is both human friendly and commonly used while still providing enough structure for
					user agent extraction.</p>

				<p>Authors have a choice of lists (ordered or unordered) to construct their table of contents. By
					tagging each link within these lists in anchor tags (<a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
						elements</a>), user agents can easily differentiate the information they need from any
					peripheral content (asides) or stylistic tagging that has also been added. The table of contents can
					consist of both active links (with an <code>href</code> attribute) and inactive links (excluding the
						<code>href</code> attribute), providing additional flexibility in how the table of contents is
					constructed (e.g., to omit links to certain headings or only link to certain content in a
					preview).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="app-toc-html" class="informative">
				<h3>HTML Structure</h3>

				<p>The machine-readable table of contents is defined within an [[html]] <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>. As
					described in <a href="#table-of-contents"></a>, this <code>nav</code> element has to be both the
					first element in the document and identifiable by a <code>role</code> attribute with the value
						<code>doc-toc</code>.</p>

				<p>Although the content model of the <code>nav</code> element is not restricted, user agents will only
					be able to extract a usable table of contents when the following markup guidelines are followed:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Table of Contents Title</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although a title for the table of contents is optional, to avoid having a user agent generate
							a placeholder title when one is needed, it is advised to add one. Titles are specified using
							any of the [[html]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements"
									><code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code> elements</a>. Note that only the first such
							element is recognized as the title. If a heading element is not found before the <a
								href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a>, user agents will assume that one has not been
							specified.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-list-links">List of Links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first [[html]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"
									><code>ol</code></a> or <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"
								><code>ul</code></a> list element encountered in the <code>nav</code> element is assumed
							to contain the list that defines the links into the content. This list will be found even if
							it is nested inside of <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-div-element"
								><code>div</code></a> elements, for example, as the algorithm <a
								href="#toc-ignored-elements">ignores elements</a> that are not relevant to its
							processing. The list cannot occur inside of any <a href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped
								elements</a>, however, since their internal contents are not evaluated.</p>
						<p>If the <code>nav</code> element does not contain one of these elements, then user agents will
							not register the digital publication as containing a usable table of contents (e.g., a
							machine-rendered option will not be available).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-branches">Branches</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If the table of contents is considered as a tree of links, then each list item (<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-li-element"><code>li</code>
								element</a>) inside of the <a href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a> represents one
							branch. Each of these branches has to have a name and optional destination in order to be
							presented to users, and this information is obtained from the first <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
								element</a> found within the list item, <a href="#toc-ignored-elements">wherever it is
								nested</a> (again, excluding any <code>a</code> elements inside of <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped elements</a>.)</p>
						<p>The link destination for the branch is obtained from the <code>a</code> element's
								<code>href</code> attribute, when specified. This attribute can be omitted if a link is
							not available (e.g., in a preview) or not relevant (e.g., a grouping header). When providing
							a link into the content, it is also possible to specify the relation of the linked document
							(in a <code>rel</code> attribute) and the media type of the linked resource (in a
								<code>type</code> attribute).</p>
						<p>After finding the <code>a</code> element that labels the branch, user agents will continue to
							inspect the markup for another list element (i.e., sub-branches). If a list is found, it is
							similarly processed to extract its links, and so on, until there are no more nested branches
							left to process.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-skipped-elements">Skipped Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A small set of elements are ignored when the parsing table of contents to avoid
							misinterpretation. These are the [[html]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#sectioning-content">sectioning content
								elements</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#sectioning-roots"
								>sectioning root elements</a>. The reason they are ignored is because they can defined
							their own outlines (i.e., they can represent embedded content that is self-contained and not
							necessarily related to the structure of content links).</p>
						<p>Any element that has its <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute"><code>hidden</code>
								attribute</a> set is also skipped, since hidden elements are not intended to be directly
							accessed by users.</p>
						<p>Although these elements can be included in the <code>nav</code> element, care has to be taken
							not to embed important content within them (e.g., do not wrap a <code>section</code> element
							around the list item that contains all the links into the content).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-ignored-elements">Ignored Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All elements that are not relevant to extracting the table of contents, and are not <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped</a>, are ignored. Unlike skipped elements, ignoring
							means that user agents will continue to search inside them for relevant content, allowing
							greater flexibility in terms of the tagging that can be used.</p>

				<h3>User Agent Processing</h3>

				<p>This section defines an algorithm for extracting a table of contents from a <code>nav</code> element.
					It is defined in terms of a walk over the nodes of a DOM tree, in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree order</a>, with each node
					being visited when it is <em>entered</em> and when it is <em>exited</em> during the walk. Each time
					a node is visited, it can be seen as triggering an <em>enter</em> or <em>exit</em> event.</p>

				<p class="note">For illustrative purposes, the examples in this section show the structure of the table
					of contents as JavaScript objects. User agents can process and internalize the resulting structure
					in whatever language and form is appropriate.</p>

				<p>For the purposes of this algorithm, a <dfn>list element</dfn> is defined as either an [[!html]] <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"><code>ol</code></a> or <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"><code>ul</code></a>
					element.</p>

				<p>The following algorithm MUST be applied to a walk of a DOM subtree rooted at the first
						<code>nav</code> element in document order with the <code>role</code> attribute value
						<code>doc-toc</code>. All explanations are <em>informative</em>.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Let <em>toc</em> be a object that represents the table of contents and initialize it as
							follows:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a <code>name</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents the title of the
								table of contents and set to an empty string.</li>

							<li>Create an <code>entries</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents all the
								branches of the table of contents and set to an empty array.</li>
						</ol>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>This step initializes the <em>toc</em> object that will store the title and the branches
								of the table of contents.</p>
							<aside class="example" title="Visualization of the default toc object">
								<pre>

							</aside>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Initialize a stack.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>The stack is used to hold branches that are not yet complete. As a new sub-branch is
								encountered, the parent gets pushed onto the stack so it can be retrieved later.</p>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Let <em>current toc branch</em> be a variable set to <code>null</code>.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p><em>current toc branch</em> is used to hold the object that represents the branch of the
								table of contents that is currently being processed.</p>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Walk over the DOM in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree
								order</a>, starting with the <code>nav</code> element the table of contents is being
							built from, and trigger the first relevant step below for each element as the walk enters
							and exits it.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>When entering a <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#heading-content-2">heading
											content</a> element:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Run these steps:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>If the stack is empty, and the <code>name</code> property of <em>toc</em> is an
										empty string, calculate the <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_te"
											>accessible name</a> [[!accname-1.1]] of the element. If the resulting value
										is not an empty string after trimming all leading and trailing whitespace, set
										the <code>name</code> property of <em>toc</em> to the value. Otherwise, set the
											<code>name</code> property either to a placeholder value or to
											<code>null</code>.</li>
									<li>Exit the element and continue processing with the next element.</li>
								</ol>
								<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>This step identifies the heading for the table of contents. A heading is only
										processed if the value of the <em>toc</em>
										<code>name</code> property is an empty string (i.e., no headings have yet been
										encountered).</p>
									<aside class="example" title="Visualization of the toc object with a heading">
										<pre>
{
   "name": "Contents",
   "entries": []
}</pre>
									</aside>
									<p>If the <code>name</code> is not an empty string, or is <code>null</code>, then a
										previous heading has already been encountered or content has been encountered
										that indicates the <code>nav</code> element does not have a heading (e.g., a
										list has already been processed, since the heading would not follow the list of
										links).</p>
									<aside class="example" title="Visualization of the toc object without a heading">
										<pre>

									<p>This algorithm does not process multiple lists in a single branch or at the root
										of the <code>nav</code> element, so if a list has already been encountered (the
											<code>entries</code> property contains one or more branches or is set to
											<code>null</code>), this list is skipped.</p>
									<p>If a list is encountered and the table of contents (<code>toc</code>) still does
										not have a name (i.e., no heading element has been encountered), the table of
										contents is assumed to not have a heading (i.e., the heading for the table of
										contents cannot appear after the first list of entries). The value of the
											<code>name</code> property is changed from an empty string to
											<code>null</code> as no further headings encountered apply, either.</p>

									<p>Exiting a list item indicates that processing of the current branch is complete.
										Before adding this branch to its parent's <code>entries</code> array, the branch
										needs to be tested to see if it has a name and/or any sub-branches. If it does
										not have a name but has sub-branches, the branch is kept. The user agent can
										either supply a placeholder value of its own creation or set the value to null.
										If it does not have a name or any branches, it is invalid and is discarded.</p>
									<p>To determine where to merge the branch, the stack is checked. If there are no
										objects in the stack, it is added into the <code>entries</code> property of the
										root <em>toc</em> object (i.e., it is a top-level branch). Otherwise, it gets
										added into the <code>entries</code> property of the object immediately preceding
										it in the stack.</p>

				<dt id="WP-diagram-descr">Description for the <a href="#WP-diagram">"Structure of Web Publications"
						diagram</a>:</dt>
				<dd>A simplified diagram of the structure of a <a>Web Publication</a>. The Web Publication is broken
					down into two elements. The first element is the actual contents (all the real things listed in the
					manifest). This element is broken down into the CSS, the actual "things" such as the <abbr
						title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, audio, etc, and the images, fonts etc.
					The actual "things" have an additional subset of items that includes the entry page to the
					publication and all of the other documents. The second element is the Manifest (JSON). The manifest
					is used to generate the canonical manifest, which consists of a list of all the "things" in the
					publication, the publication metadata, and the default reading order of content. It is noted in the
					diagram that the entry page has to link to the manifest. (<a role="doc-backlink" href="#WP-diagram"
