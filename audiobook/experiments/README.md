# Audiobook Experiments

The [experiments folder](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/tree/master/audiobook/experiments) lists various initiatives (example files, books, publications, etc.) that have been undertaken by the Working Group as part of the development of the [Audiobooks specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/audiobook). These experiments, by their nature, may become obsolete as the final specification evolves, but are retained here nevertheless.
