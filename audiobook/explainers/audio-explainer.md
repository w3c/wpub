# Audiobooks Explainer 
## What is an audiobook and why are we doing this?
This sounds like an easy question, a “book with audio”! Audiobooks, for the purposes of the scope of our work right now, are publications that are primarily audio-based. Audiobooks can contain non-audio content like supplements or navigational documents, but the content is in audio format. 

Audiobooks have grown massively in popularity in the last few years despite being a segment of the industry for far longer. The main reason for this shift is due to several technologies:
* Mobile devices (phones and tablets)
* Improved mobile networks (3G, 4G LTE)
* Improved mobile storage capacity
* Widespread use of wifi

When previously audiobook users would need several CDs to listen to their audiobook, they can now stream, download, and listen to their chosen content anywhere and time they choose. Audiobooks, like ebooks, are now in their pockets on demand. 

The main difference between ebooks and audiobooks currently is their level of specification. EPUB has existed in one form or another for almost 20 years, but audiobooks still do not have a common specification. A mature ebooks industry has co-opted audiobooks to make them work within the same contexts, but the lack of a specification has made this process arduous for user agents and by extension, users. 

An audiobooks spec would also help with B2B relationships. Today publishers have to deal with multiple non-standards, preparing files and metadata differently for each audiobook distributor. This results in duplicated effort, increases the chances of errors, and makes the supply chain less efficient.

It is in the interest of users, creators, and distributors that we push to create a single specification for audiobooks. 
## Goals
* Create a specification for the audiobook format that is usable on both the web and in packaged contexts
* Create a specification that supports all of the major use cases of audio
* Create a specification that is accessible
* Create a specification that meets the needs and requirements of publishers, user agents, and users
## Out of Scope
* Synced media -- though the needs of sync media in a metadata/structure context will be taken into account
* DRM (as outlined by our charter)
## Key Use Cases
The Audiobooks Task Force has identified the definition of an essential audiobook experience as:
* A format that can be listened to from beginning to end without user input (moving forwards/backwards through the reading order without manual input)
* A format that can be paused, played, moved forwards and backwards
* A format where the listening position is retained for the next reading session
* A format where the user can access the table of contents at any time
* A format where the user can always find their position
* A format where the user knows how long is remaining in the chapter/section/audiobook
* A format that can be streamed, offlined, and downloaded
* A format with clear metadata supported for user libraries (title, author, narrator, cover, duration, etc.)


## How It Works

The basic idea is simple: put all the audio files, a cover image, any supplemental material, and some metadata in a folder, and zip the folder. 

The tricky part is the metadata. We use the term "manifest" to describe the list of audio files, in order, that make up the book. The manifest also includes bibliographic metadata, and identifies special resources like a cover image or a table of contents. To make all that information easily machine-readable, it's written in a format called JSON. We expect that there will be simple tools available to create this format. 

The manifest format comes from the W3C's [Web Publication Manifest](https://w3c.github.io/wpub/) spec, which we hope will be used for many different types of publications.

### Sample Folder

## Considered Alternatives

There were several considered alternatives:


#### [DAISY Talking Books](http://www.daisy.org/daisypedia/daisy-digital-talking-book)

*Editorial note: do we have input from DAISY on the current status of this?*

#### HTML Custom Elements

HTML does have an `audio` element. It would be possible to have the Primary Entry Page of the Web Publication be an HTML page that contains `audio` elements for each constituent resource. Someone wrote a custom element called  [x-playlist](https://github.com/heff/x-playlist) that wrapped a sequence of audio elements, auto-playing them in order with no intervention. A member of the working group created a [sample audio book](https://dauwhe.github.io/html-first/flatland-custom-element/) using this approach.

#### EPUB 3 Audio Books

The existing EPUB 3 specification could be changed to allow audio core media types as spine items. We could then take advantage of EPUB's existing metadata and packaging features. 

#### M4B

M4B is an audiobook format based on the [MPEG-4 Part 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14) container specification. They can contain multiple audio files, a cover image, and metadata. Audio book providers such as Librevox often supply M4B to end users. They can be played in iTunes.
